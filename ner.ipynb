      " Paul Krugman column: Learn to stop worrying and love government debt Amid all the wild swings in U.S. politics over the past decade, one thing has remained constant: the GOP position on government debt. The party considers high levels of debt an existential threat — if a Democrat is sitting in the White House. If a Republican president presides over big deficits, well, as Donald Trump’s budget director reportedly told supporters last year, “nobody cares.” So it’s a completely safe prediction that once Joe Biden is sworn in, we will once again hear lots of righteous Republican ranting about the evils of borrowing. What’s less clear is whether we’ll see a repeat of what happened during the Obama years, when many centrists — and much of the news media — both took obvious fiscal phonies seriously and joined in the chorus of fearmongering. Advertisement Let’s hope not. For the fact is that we’ve learned a lot about the economics of government debt over the past few years — enough so that Olivier Blanchard, the eminent former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is talking about a “shift in fiscal paradigm.” And the new paradigm suggests both that public debt isn’t a major problem and that government borrowing for the right purposes is actually the responsible thing to do. Why are economists thinking differently about debt? Part of the answer is that we’ve discovered some things about how the world works; the rest of the answer is that the world has changed.

Dendias and Christodoulides were meeting ... more > NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Turkey’s recent moves to de-escalate a clash with Greece and Cyprus over east Mediterranean energy reserves are “unconvincing” and European Union leaders need to take action that will prompt Ankara to heed international law, Greece’s foreign minister said on Friday. Nikos Dendias said Turkey opted not to seize an opportunity that European Union leaders offered it in October to ease tensions in the region so that the 27-member bloc could start reshaping its fraught relations with Ankara. Turkey last week ordered the research vessel Oruc Reis back to port after completing what it said was seismic research in east Mediterranean waters. The warship-escorted vessel’s activities in waters where Greece asserts jurisdiction prompted a military build-up between the two neighbors and nominal NATO allies.\n",

Justin Patrick Obert, 32, Fort Myers, received the sentence that also includes three years of supervised release for communicating a false distress message to the Coast Guard, according to a release from the office of U.S. Attorney Maria Chapa Lopez. Advertisement The federal court also ordered Obert to pay $13,414.78 to the Coast Guard for the cost of the operation. The sentencing comes after Obert’s guilty plea in the U.S. District Court on Aug. 21. The release said Obert had on Sept. 9, 2019 “drunkenly discharged two red distress flares from a vessel near Fort Myers Beach, triggering an emergency search and rescue operation by the United States Coast Guard, Fort Myers Beach Fire Rescue and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission.” “Hoax calls put the public at risk,” said Coast Guard Sector St. Petersburg Commander Capt. Matt Thompson in the release. “Mariners on the water rely and count on Coast Guard assets and personnel to be ready and able to respond when they are in distress. Hoax calls can redirect critical rescue capabilities and put lives at risk in the dangerous maritime domain.”\n",

      " New Delhi: A day ahead of the fifth round of negotiations with the Centre on the contentious agriculture marketing bills, farmer organisations on Friday gave a call for a Bharat andh on 8 December. The coalition, which is leading the protests, Samyukt Kisan Morcha, further announced that they will occupy toll booths and block all roads to the national capital, Delhi, and burn effigies of corporate houses and government leaders. \"We are firm on the decision that these laws must be withdrawn... we are prepared for a long struggle,\" said H. S. Lakhowal, a farmer leader from Punjab, while announcing the decision. On Thursday, during an 8-hour long meeting with farmers, the government proposed to change certain provisions of the bills but the offer was rejected by farmer groups. Farmers have instead demanded that the government call a special session of the Parliament to repeal the acts. Going by discussions among farmer organisations on Friday, Saturday’s meeting with the government is unlikely to end the ongoing deadlock. “There is no possibility of diluting the position that these laws have to go. There is no sympathy within the movement to offer a face-saver for the government during negotiations,\" said an insider who did not want to be named. Since 27 November, thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana have occupied highways bordering the national capital of Delhi with their tractor-trolleys, demanding that the government withdraw the bills and make assured purchases at support prices a legal entitlement. Farmers fear that by weakening state regulated markets and widening the role of private corporations in direct purchase of crops, the reforms will dilute existing state purchase of food grains at minimum support prices (MSP). Farmer organisations from around the country are joining the agitation every day and we are firm on our stand, said Hannan Mollah, former MP and member of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee.\n",

Klopp argued that the chief execs from top flight clubs are simply not interested in the mental health and well-being of players after the issue failed to be mentioned at a Premier League meeting on Thursday.

      " A conservative Christian is baffled by Trump’s behavior | Letters Trump’s behavior baffling I’m a conservative Christian. It’s just the way I believe, I can’t help myself. And I just don’t get the behavior of our current president. History has recorded many individuals who have held a cultlike grip on their followers. The leader is never wrong and verifiable truth is irrelevant. Followers may be willing to resort to violence to further their leader’s goals. Cult leaders have absolutely no patience for those who either disobey or disagree with them, and those who do face retribution. Having a penchant for repeating again and again what only he perceives as truth is another technique in the cult leader’s playbook. Any of this sound familiar? Advertisement Despite our president’s accomplishments while in office (and there are many), his seeming unwillingness to assertively denounce those who threaten violence in his name is morally reprehensible. Doesn’t anyone find it terrifying that such an obvious course of action doesn’t seem to have even occurred to him? During the last four years the media has found our President’s antics addictive. He plays them like fish on a hook. They can’t keep from obsessively reporting on his self-delusional fabrications. It’s become the new normal. Amazingly, they’ve given him the power to delegitimize our next president’s four years in office in the minds of millions of his followers, despite Attorney General William Barr’s statement that he’s seen no evidence of fraud found in the election process.\n",

The guidelines issued by ASCI on November 24 to ensure that the fantasy gaming ads are transparent and protect consumers will be effective from 15 December 2020. In the new rules, no gaming advertisement can depict a person below the age of 18, engaging in a game of online gaming for real money win or suggesting that such persons can play these games. All such gaming advertisements should carry disclaimers on the fact that the game involves an element of financial risk, may be addictive and that users should play at their own risk. These should occupy no less than 20% of the space in the print ads. In case of audio or visual programmes, the disclaimer must be placed in normal speaking pace at the end of the advertisement, it must be in the same language as the advertisement, and play out in both audio and visual formats. Further, the advertisements should not present ‘online gaming for real money winnings’ as an income opportunity or as an alternative employment option. They should also not suggest that a person engaged in gaming activity is more successful as compared to others. Broadcasters should also ensure that online gaming advertisements do not promote any activity prohibited by statute or law.\n",

      " Terrie Rizzo won’t seek another term as chairwoman of the Florida Democratic Party, she announced Thursday in a letter sent to party leaders. Her decision not to run for another term effectively ends her three-year tenure, during which the party gave up a U.S. Senate seat, failed to win the governorship and most recently lost the battle for the state’s rich trove of 29 Electoral College votes in the presidential election. By stepping down, Rizzo avoided mounting scrutiny over the losses. Advertisement Critics blistered the party for failing to offset a finely tuned campaign for President Donald Trump. They said the Democrats failed to keep in touch with important constituent groups such as Hispanics, African-Americans and thousands of wage earners who are struggling to make ends meet during the COVID-19 pandemic. Beyond the Trump win, Democrats lost seats in the U.S. and state houses and two promising state Senate races in Seminole and Miami-Dade counties. And how it happened has a familiar ring. The party infrastructure either isn’t there or is pieced together at the last moment. Outreach to key constituencies, such as African-Americans and Hispanics, comes too late in the election. Candidates don’t aggressively use the tools they do have to target voters and get out the base. “We have to get back to the party of engaging voters year-round,” said state Sen. Shevrin Jones, D-West Park, who won his race in South Florida on Nov. 3. “You can’t continue to come to the Black community in the late hours asking for them to take them to our churches ... and then you drop them like a bad habit after the election.”\n",

      " Stadium safety protocols: While the state of North Carolina allows 7 percent seating capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic, Duke is not hosting fans at its games. Quick slant: The Miami Hurricanes return to game action for the first time since Nov. 14 due to a coronavirus outbreak on the team. Although Duke is an annual ACC Coastal matchup for UM, the Blue Devils weren’t on the original revised schedule amid the pandemic as the ACC went without divisions for the 2020 season. Miami was set to return to play Wake Forest, but the Demon Deacons began dealing with COVID issues, Duke became available as its meeting with Florida State was canceled, opening the possibility for a matchup. About No. 10 Miami (7-1, 6-1 ACC): The Hurricanes still have slim hopes of reaching the ACC Championship Game, but they will be eliminated from contention if they lose at Duke or if Clemson wins at Virginia Tech. Regardless, winning out in the regular season would put UM in a New Year’s Six bowl game, possibly the Orange Bowl. About Duke (2-7, 1-7): The Blue Devils’ one conference win came against one-win Syracuse. They have given up 56 points each of their last two times out, in losses to North Carolina and Georgia Tech. As rough as it’s been for coach David Cutcliffe’s team this season, Miami doesn’t need to be reminded that it has lost to Duke each of the last two seasons. Three things to watch 1. How do the Hurricanes come out in Durham? Coach Manny Diaz said they’ll have enough depth on all position groups, but are they shorthanded on some? Then, how much will the rust of two Saturdays without a game have on their performance? UM’s conditioning, tackling, play on special teams and whether they’re committing turnovers will be factors to watch regarding that rust. 2. Can Miami win one with some style points, in more convincing fashion against a team like Duke? That’s what a lot of fans would like to see after the last three wins — Virginia, North Carolina State, Virginia Tech — have come by a combined 9 points.\n",

      " Consumer confidence during the month of November showed signs of slight improvement even though households and companies remained pessimistic about the current state of economic recovery according to a survey by the Reserve bank of India (RBI) released on Friday. While consumer confidence for November '20 remained low at 52.3 points but rose from 49.9 points in September, which was a record low. However consumer confidence showed a marked improvement for a year ahead period scoring 115.9 points reflecting long term optimism. An index value below 100 represents pessimism, while a reading above 100 signals optimism. The survey was based on responses from 5,319 households across 13 major cities. \"Consumer confidence remained very low in November 2020 when compared to a year ago, as reflected in the current situation index, though it showed a marginal improvement over the all-time low recorded in the previous round,\" said the survey. Weak confidence is attributable to the consumer sentiments on general economic situation, employment scenario, price levels and household incomes. Analysts said though price pressures prevailing in the domestic economy have been more severe than it was earlier estimated, it's positive that the RBI expects a faster economic recovery and has revised upwards its outlook for GDP growth for FY21. Among key parameters, perceptions around employment, income and spending showed improvement for a year ahead. However, the central bank's outlook for inflation has turned adverse leading it to raise its outlook on price levels. \"Outlook has turned adverse from earlier estimates. Supply side disruption pushing up consumer prices,\" said Care Ratings, adding that although cereal prices are expected to soften with kharif harvest arrival and vegetable prices to ease with the winter crop, other food prices remain at elevated levels. Core inflation could firm up as economic activity normalizes and demand picks up, said Care Ratings. To be sure, while demand is expected to improve, respondents reported higher essential and overall spending, though discretionary expenditure contracted; non-essential spending is expected to contract further in the coming year. Though the domestic economy contracted by 7.5% in the second quarter of this fiscal, in the third quarter various high frequency indicators point to a recovery gaining traction. Also, domestic financial conditions remained easy in October-November and systemic liquidity continued to be in large surplus. During April-October 2020 corporate bond issuances have been higher at Rs. 4.4 lakh crore as against Rs.3.5 lakh crore during the same period last year. India’s foreign exchange reserves were US$ 574.8 billion (as on November 27), up from US$ 545.6 billion on October 2.\n",

The stage is set for one of the most enthralling North London derbies in years as Tottenham host Arsenal on Sunday afternoon. Spurs have recently shown their mettle with positive results against Manchester City and Chelsea, and victory over the Gunners would surely establish beyond any doubt their status as Premier League title contenders. Arsenal will be desperate to topple the league leaders but must overcome their form and the history books to do so. Mikel Arteta's side are winless in three league games, while Arsenal's last away victory in a North London derby came all the way back in 2014. Arteta, who started the 1-0 victory six-and-a-half years ago, knows the ideal route to relieve the pressure on his shoulders would be to beat Jose Mourinho's high-fliers.

      " NEW DELHI: The Modi government offered to re-open stalled free trade talks with the European Union (EU) several times since 2014 but it was the EU that was hesitant to do so, Indian foreign minister S Jaishankar said on Friday. Addressing a session of the Mediterranean Dialogue, Jaishankar also made a strong case for migration describing it as “a human expression of the transfer of technology, of the promotion of innovation, of the building of business, and of the sharing of knowledge.\" Responding to a question of why India did not join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership pact signed recently creating the world’s largest free trade area and whether India would re-open talks with the EU, Jaishankar clarified that in the past six years, India had broached the subject to the EU. “The government of prime minister Modi offered to the EU that we would like to reopen or continue to those (FTA) negotiations. In fact it was the EU which took the stance from 2014 saying that ‘right we have other priorities I don’t know if we are ready,’\" the minister said. “So for the last six years …. the reluctance to engage from 2014 -- this I can testify personally -- is not from India’s side, it is from the EU side even today,\" he said dispelling the idea that its India’s reluctance that has been holding up efforts to re-open negotiations. India and the EU started talks on a free trade pact in 2007 but negotiations were stalled in 2013 and efforts to resume the negotiations since have not succeeded. During a virtual summit between India and the EU in July, both sides agreed to set up a high level mechanism to explore the possibility of restarting talks on the pact. Last month however, an Indian official said there was some “forward movement\" on the matter. On migration and mobility, Jaishankar said that India and the EU had an ongoing dialogue on the subject.\n",

He told how measurements indicated that the car was traveling at a speed of 120kph on a road governed by an 80kph speed limit. The weather was not a factor, the road was in good condition and the car was also in a good serviceable condition at the time of the accident, he added.

The court was told that two of the men, Michael Roarty and John Harley, were not wearing seatbelts at the time of the crash.

      " Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has warned England boss Gareth Southgate he will have a problem for Euro 2020 as he will “get what he is given” by Premier League clubs if the current three-substitute rule persists. Klopp has been the most vocal proponent of a return to having the option to make five changes during a match, in line with what happened after lockdown ended last season. However, despite him and a number of other managers supporting the move there was no vote on it at this week’s Premier League meeting. “I’m not surprised. I told you that in the managers’ meeting (in November) if we would have voted that day, which we were not allowed to, it would have been through 100 per cent with 15 or 16 votes,” he said. “That it didn’t happen since then is a sign some shareholders and CEOs and sporting directors see differently from their managers. “That is not a good sign, really, to be honest. These people now really ignore player welfare. “Now pretty much all teams have to play every three days, it will be massive for everybody from now on and every team will feel the difference.\n",

      " Breakingviews - Hershey cocoa spat tests limits of investor ethics Cocoa pods are seen in a cocoa farm in Anyama, Ivory Coast July 21, 2017. LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ethical investing has become the battlefield in a dispute between Hershey and cocoa-producing countries. Ghana and Ivory Coast have accused the Reese’s maker of dodging payments designed to alleviate farmer poverty and have shut off access to cocoa certified as sustainable from their countries. The move may make it harder for the $31 billion group to flaunt its environmental, social and governance credentials. Ahead of elections, both countries this year introduced a $400 a tonne premium on cocoa to support local farmers. Yet Accra and Yamoussoukro now say that Hershey tried to avoid paying this by sourcing a large batch of the raw material through futures on the ICE Futures U.S. exchange, which might have been backed by last year’s crop. That may have been advantageous given the collapse in cocoa prices after a bumper harvest and a pandemic hit to demand. If dodging the surcharge was part of Hershey’s plan, the strategy would have had a short shelf life. In future years, any counterparty sourcing cocoa from the countries would pay the fee, passing on the cost. Still, both countries have retaliated by closing down Hershey’s sustainability schemes, which invest in local farms, ensure minimum labour standards and certify its chocolate as sustainable. It could be a problem. Hershey boasts that its chocolate is 100% sustainable, verified by independent auditors who follow international labour and environmental standards. That puts it ahead of rivals Mondelez and Mars, who have set the same target for 2025. Losing the ethical badge could make it harder to charge premium prices and would spook investors, who claim to value companies’ social credentials. To maintain that advantage, Hershey must either patch things up with the two countries in time for next year’s crop – presumably by paying any missed surcharge – or find new, sustainable suppliers elsewhere. The latter may be hard to do immediately, given that Ghana and Ivory Coast represent around two-thirds of the global market.\n",

      " ‘Black Bear’ review: Aubrey Plaza stars in a meta-thriller on relationships and filmmaking By Katie Walsh Tribune News Service| Dec 04, 2020 at 9:24 AM Lawrence Michael Levine’s third feature, “Black Bear,” ends with an appropriate dedication: “For Sophia.” His wife, filmmaker Sophia Takal, produced and co-starred in his first two features, 2010′s “Gabi on the Roof in July” and the 2014 mystery caper “Wild Canaries.” It’s appropriate because “Black Bear,” Levine’s best film yet, is a fascinating meta-commentary on marriage, filmmaking and making movies with your spouse. In another extra-textually resonant layer, Aubrey Plaza, who frequently works with her longtime partner, director Jeff Baena (“The Little Hours”), stars as Allison. In “Part One: The Bear on the Road,” she’s a filmmaker retreating to a lakeside compound in upstate New York to work on her next screenplay. Her hosts are Gabe (Christopher Abbott) and Blair (Sarah Gadon), an attractive, expectant couple, Brooklyn refugees hoping to make a little money with the family property. An increasingly wine-soaked dinner devolves into a messy argument about making art, gender roles and society’s ills, which crescendos to a violent climax. Advertisement\n",

      " Paul Krugman column: Learn to stop worrying and love government debt Amid all the wild swings in U.S. politics over the past decade, one thing has remained constant: the GOP position on government debt. The party considers high levels of debt an existential threat — if a Democrat is sitting in the White House. If a Republican president presides over big deficits, well, as Donald Trump’s budget director reportedly told supporters last year, “nobody cares.” So it’s a completely safe prediction that once Joe Biden is sworn in, we will once again hear lots of righteous Republican ranting about the evils of borrowing. What’s less clear is whether we’ll see a repeat of what happened during the Obama years, when many centrists — and much of the news media — both took obvious fiscal phonies seriously and joined in the chorus of fearmongering. Advertisement Let’s hope not. For the fact is that we’ve learned a lot about the economics of government debt over the past few years — enough so that Olivier Blanchard, the eminent former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is talking about a “shift in fiscal paradigm.” And the new paradigm suggests both that public debt isn’t a major problem and that government borrowing for the right purposes is actually the responsible thing to do. Why are economists thinking differently about debt? Part of the answer is that we’ve discovered some things about how the world works; the rest of the answer is that the world has changed.

(Al Drago/The New York Times) If we can’t get a COVID-19 relief package through Congress in the next week or two, we’re sunk. It means we have a legislative branch so ideologically divided it can’t address even our most glaring problems. It means we have representatives so lacking in the willingness and ability to compromise that minimally competent government will be impossible, even under a President Joe Biden. The problems a basic relief measure would address couldn’t be more obvious. Under current law, up to 12 million Americans could lose their jobless benefits by year’s end — a wretched Christmastime for millions of families, which could spawn a wave of depression, morbidity, family breakdown and suicide.\n",

      " Top congressional Democrats ratcheted up the pressure to strike a coronavirus stimulus deal Friday after new data showed sluggish jobs growth in the face of an infection surge. Nonfarm payrolls grew by 245,000 in November, falling significantly below expectations of 440,000. The sign of a flagging economic recovery comes amid a renewed congressional effort to pass a pandemic relief bill before the end of the year. Democratic leaders, who have for months called for a sweeping package to boost the U.S. economy and health-care system, cited the report as further justification for Congress to act. \"This latest jobs report shows the need for strong, urgent emergency relief is more important than ever,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement. \"Senate Republicans are increasingly understanding this urgency, and Leader McConnell should hear their pleas as well as those of the millions of struggling American families.\" \"This jobs report is blaring warning that a double-dip recession is looming and must be a wakeup call for anyone who is standing in the way of true bipartisan emergency relief,\" he continued. Optimism about an agreement has increased in recent days as talks pick up on Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke Thursday about both an aid package and a government funding bill Congress needs to pass by Dec. 11.

      " iPhone 12 Pro has been on sale for a while now. A few users of the Apple flagship iPhone claim that their new devices are experiencing aggressive battery drain issues, despite their phone being on standby. Apple is popular to optimizing their hardware and software extremely well, which provides an impressive standby time in terms of battery life. The issue was raised on an Apple’s discussions forum where a user complained that a new iPhone 12 Pro was showing an unusual battery activity. The complainant with the username Master26A claimed that despite his/her new iPhone 12 Pro screen being off most of the time, the battery was draining much quicker. The user even turned off 5G, which has proved to have a heavy impact on smartphone battery. However, that did not affect the battery drainage issue. Other iPhone 12 Pro users also came forward in response to the post as reported a similar issue with their newly bought iPhone 12 Pro. Many users have shared their battery graphs along with their screen on/off statistics. While the screen is apparently turned off for a few hours at a stretch, the battery drain continues at the same pace. Apple has reduced the battery size on the new iPhone 12 Pro and even the iPhone 12 Pro Max compared to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Despite the slightly smaller battery size and the more power-hungry 5G connectivity, not all iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max users have reported any such issue with the battery drain. Apple is yet to acknowledge the issue. Considering that many users have come forward to report an almost identical issue, the problem could be fixed through a future software update.\n",

      " What goes up must come down and then usually goes back up again, at least in the case of the U.S. stock market. The market has been on a roller-coaster ride this year amid the coronavirus pandemic. The S&P 500 started the year strong, breaking the record for the longest-ever bull market. Then, in March, when the pandemic slammed the U.S. with sweeping lockdowns that brought most economic activity to a halt, the index tanked, falling 30% in 22 trading days and officially entering bear territory. Stocks have since rebounded with surprising strength, climbing to multiple all-time highs even as Covid-19 cases continue to soar. Through Thursday's close, the S&P 500 has gained more than 13% year to date, and nearly 64% from its March 23 low. \"We have had tremendous support both on the fiscal and the monetary side that have supported markets in the downturn,\" said Charlie Ripley, vice president of capital markets at Allianz Investment Management. \"It's sort of supported to perfection.\" Weigh risk vs. reward For those investing long-term, such as for retirement, staying in the market is often the best strategy, according to financial advisors. Investors who panicked in March and sold assets may now be kicking themselves after the tremendous recovery the market has seen since. Even though it's tempting to retreat from the risks of the stock market when things go haywire, it's important to remember that investing means trading some volatility for the reward of growing wealth.\n",

      " While Sony delays the India launch of its PlayStation 5, Microsoft is ready with both its next generation gaming consoles — the Xbox Series X and Series S. The Xbox Series X is the company’s true “next-gen\" console, but the Series S is arguably more important for India. It’s meant to be the digital console, eliminating DVDs forever and while it suits Indian buyers in many ways, it’s also easy to argue against the Xbox Series S. The console is significantly smaller than older Xbox consoles and doesn’t have the DVD drive, meaning you will be downloading all your games. If you have a metered Internet connection, this might drain your data limits when you're shifting from older to the newer console. Unless you kept all your games on an external storage drive, you will have to redownload your entire library on the new console. Speaking of your library, that’s where the first big problem with the Xbox Series S comes in. The console has 512GB base storage, with less 364GB for you to use. In practice, that means less than 10 games at a time on the device’s internal storage. And that upper limit is assuming you somehow don’t play large AAA titles. For a digital only console, it’s mighty unfair of Microsoft to cap the storage at such low levels. Why is internal storage so important? Because one of the highlights of this new console is that it’s faster where it matters. To use a term commonly associated with smartphone interfaces, apps are ‘snappier’, games load noticeably faster and there’s a “quick resume\" feature, which allows you to freeze multiple games in the background and pick up where you left off. How many games you freeze at a time will depend on whether the games you’re playing support the features. Forza Horizon 4 is one game that doesn’t. But quick resume works only when the games are on the console’s in-built storage. The Series has ports for an external drive, but it won’t take full advantage of the new stuff. Microsoft’s solution for this is to sell storage cards, a slot for which is available on the back of the Series S. This is a tiny memory card-like device that will essentially become part of the console’s internal storage and take advantage of all its features. These cards don’t seem to be available in India right now, but the Xbox website does direct you to Flipkart and Amazon, suggesting that they will sell here. A 1TB storage card sells for about $220 in the US and we didn’t get a response from Microsoft on how much they will cost here. All this is essentially meant to force you towards Microsoft’s other idea for this console — GamePass Ultimate. This is the company’s game subscription service, where you pay Rs. 699 per month to gain access to over 200 games. It almost seems like the company expects people to pay for GamePass and download a game or two at a time, instead of maintaining a library of games they own. While that may be the future of gaming, it really seems forced for those of us who have built libraries over the years.\n",

I lost about 25 pounds,\" Farley, who is in his mid-40s, said on \"Squawk Box.\" \"I looked like Skeletor, cracked a tooth from chattering. I felt like somebody was taking a sledgehammer to my back,\" he added, referencing the Mattel supervillain from the Masters of the Universe franchise. Farley, who oversaw the NYSE from 2014 to 2018, said he had his \"nasty case\" of Covid-19 in March. At the time, he said his special purpose acquisition company was in the process of finalizing a deal with a merger target while the uncertainty caused by the fledging pandemic unsettled global financial markets. \"It was at the exact time the S&P seemed to go down like 5% a day,\" said Farley, whose first SPAC completed its merger in August with Global Blue, a Swiss fintech firm. He now serves as the company's chairman. \"My brain wasn't firing. I was physically exhausted. It was not a good period in my life,\" Farley said. \"On that 23rd day, I woke up and yes, I was weak, but I felt better and I felt hopeful and optimistic, and I started getting into a workout routine.\"\n",

      " Raven Leilani's 'Luster' Wins Center For Fiction First Novel Prize The ceremony took place on Thursday, December 3. The Center for Fiction awarded its First Novel Prize, which recognizes the year's best debut novel and carries a $15,000 monetary gift, to Luster by Raven Leilani at its Annual Awards Benefit on Thursday, December 3, with actor and comedian Yvonne Orji emceeing the virtual event. The organization also presented its On Screen Award to James McBride and SHOWTIME for its original series \"The Good Lord Bird\" and its Medal for Editorial Excellence to publisher and editor Chris Jackson of One World, an imprint of Random House. This year's Awards Benefit was dedicated in loving memory to Toni Morrison. A special performance by Laura Benanti and an appearance by Raúl Esparza bolstered the night's theme, described as \"a jubilee in celebration of the power of imagination and the will for social justice\" by Center for Fiction Board Chair Erroll McDonald. Funds raised during the Annual Awards Benefit will support the literary nonprofit's mission to champion the universality and diversity of storytelling by bringing communities of readers and writers together through public author events and performances, awards and fellowships for early-career writers, and educational programs for students in under-resourced NYC public schools. Writers Stefan Merrill Block, Halle Butler, Jenny Offill, and De'Shawn Charles Winslow, who won the 2019 First Novel Prize for In West Mills-selected Raven Leilani's Luster as the 2020 First Novel Prize winner from a short list of remarkable debut fiction by Amina Cain (Indelicacy), Maisy Card (These Ghosts Are Family), Hilary Leichter (Temporary), Corey Sobel (The Redshirt), Douglas Stuart (Shuggie Bain), and C Pam Zhang (How Much of These Hills Is Gold). \"Raven Leilani's unforgettable portrayal of Edie- a young Black woman who finds herself in a series of bizarre, dysfunctional, and darkly funny situations in her ongoing quest to discover herself-is delivered in pitch perfect prose,\" says Allison Escoto, Head Librarian and Education Director at the Center for Fiction. In her remarks, Leilani expressed gratitude to \"the librarians and the booksellers and the indie bookstores who have advocated fiercely for this book...Thank you to everyone who came to this book with generosity: it has really meant everything.\"\n",

      " The Nyys Chamber Music Program Announces Educational Video Series Highlighting Historically Underrepresented Composers The series is part of a new repertoire initiative led by NYYS Chamber Music Director Dr. Lisa Tipton, and Assistant Director Tylor Thomas. The New York Youth Symphony has announced the launch of new educational videos showcasing the history and works of composers from historically underrepresented communities. The series is part of a new repertoire initiative led by NYYS Chamber Music Director Dr. Lisa Tipton, and Assistant Director Tylor Thomas, as part of the 2020/21 season. Each show features works by five composers, including women and members of the LGBTQ+ and BIPOC communities. The series includes guest appearances by composers Libby Larsen and Beata Moon, Bronx Arts Ensemble Artistic Director Judith Insell, cellist Tomoko Fujita, pianist Adrienne Kim, and more. While the primary goal of the videos was to help NYYS students broaden their knowledge of these composers and their chamber music works, the series is resonating well beyond the NYYS. Executive Director Shauna Quill said, \"The Unsung continues our work in honoring and uplifting composers who have paved the way, and composers who continue to push for greater representation within the music community. I am proud that our students are learning these lessons, which they will carry for the rest of their lives, and I hope that others will learn from these as well.\" Dr. Tipton said, \"These videos grew out of my and Tylor's shared passion for helping our students discover new works beyond the classical canon. With each video, the project grows and becomes even more vital to a larger base of music lovers. I'm proud that some of the featured composers and our faculty coaches have been able to be part of the project, and we look forward to making many more throughout the year!\" Current episodes of The Unsung are available to view at NYYS.org/Media/TheUnsung, with more episodes forthcoming. Episode 1: Features the history and music of Urban Classical composers David Baker, Wynton Marsalis, Jeff Scott, Valerie Coleman, and Jesse Montgomery.\n",

      " Yes, you should attend your virtual work holiday party—here’s how to make the most of it This time of year, workers' calendars are usually are jam-packed with office holiday events and year-end networking opportunities. With many office workers now logging in from home, however, employers are figuring out how to approach end-of-year celebrations to acknowledge workers' contributions during a tumultuous 2020. According to a Monster survey of 1,700 respondents on Nov. 6, a majority 59% of workers said they would appreciate their company hosting a virtual holiday party, and 47% are fine with it taking taking place through a more informal video call. \"The purpose of a holiday party is to thank employees, build camaraderie, have some time to spend with colleagues and network,\" Monster career expert Vicki Salemi tells CNBC Make It. \"A video call can do all that and may be the best and safest way to acknowledge people at the end of a challenging year for both the employer and employee.\" While workers said they would miss being able to spend time with colleagues in person, as well as the usual holiday party food and drink spread, they recognized several benefits of a virtual event, such as eliminating a commute, pulling a \"Zoom exit\" to leave the event more easily and avoiding small talk with their boss. A separate poll of nearly 3,300 LinkedIn users conducted this week finds that roughly two-thirds of workers say their company is not celebrating the holidays at all this year. Another sample of just under 2,400 LinkedIn members surveyed in mid-Novemberfound that roughly 1 in 2 would prefer a bonus over other seasonal activities or celebrations, and 1 in 3 would prefer extra paid time off during the holidays. Organizations unsure of how employees want to recognize the end of the year should be transparent and simply ask, Salemi says, and accommodate where they can financially do so. For example, employees may request that funds that would otherwise be used for an in-person gathering or companywide gifts instead be distributed as a cash bonus or a charitable donation to a local cause.\n",

      " Holiday gift shopping for foodies can be challenging, especially if you don't quite share the obsession. They're usually on top of the latest trends and novelties, and they tend to snap up what they like before you can buy it for them. Ah, but they can't know everything. Below you'll find the best gifts for foodies. These cutting-edge gadgets, like a handy air fryer and convection combo oven, and high-quality analog culinary tools, such as this modern knife block or the oh-so-trendy and oh-so-often-sold-out Always Pan, will satisfy the food and drink needs of even the most discerning home chef. Plus, these cooking gifts are more creative than wine charms or a bottle of Scotch (not that we don't love Scotch). Toaster ovens have long gotten a bad rap as impersonal gifts with little to no cachet but I'm here to prove this platitude false. An air fryer lets you cook food with far less oil (olive oil or otherwise) while mimicking the effects of deep-frying -- which is scientifically proven to be the most delicious form of cooking. For me, the one big drawback with traditional air fryers is that the baskets have physical limits for what you can make in them. Not so with this chic combo air fryer and convection from Calphalon which you can use for toasting, broiling, baking, warming and air frying. it heats up fast, cooks with precision, lets you watch your food's progress through a glass door and the steely black finish won't stain or tarnish as quickly as silver.\n",
      "Best air fryer for 2020. Earlier this year I put the cookware sensation that's sweeping the nation to the test. Is it over-hyped? Maybe a smidge, but what isn't these days? That doesn't change the fact that the Always Pan is an exceedingly well designed, multipurpose ceramic skillet that makes for a thoughtful gift. This foodie gift idea is a great size, as easy to clean as any pan I've ever used and has a built-in spoon rest -- which I can't believe isn't a standard feature on more frying pans. The Always Pan is often sold out but is currently in stock and available in any one of five very pleasing colors. The maker of the Always Pan also just recently released a steamer basket insert made especially for it: Perfect for dumplings, fish and vegetables.\n",
      "Read our Always Pan review. If the foodie you're buying for has decent knives but keeps them clanging around in a drawer -- the No. 1 knife storage sin -- it's time to put an end to that abuse. This handsome Schmidt Brothers knife block is made of rich acacia and acrylic, and magnetized on both sides to store and display up to eight blades. Unless you live close to the docks, the easiest way to get quality seafood may be via one of these great online fish purveyors. Fulton Fish Market has one of the best selections anywhere -- web or otherwise -- with loads of wild salmon, trout, scallops, shellfish, caviar and more. Snatch a bundle and have this unique gift delivered directly to your giftee's home. They'll certainly appreciate making one less trip to the market.\n",
      "Catch the best seafood delivery services of 2020. You may need types of cookware depending on what you're making and the results you're after. For searing steaks, burgers, pork chops and other meats, it's hard to beat carbon steel. For one, it holds heat well, getting and staying hotter than Hades, but it's also lighter than cast iron so you can maneuver it over the stovetop easily. Pair this sleek pan with a box of quality cuts of meat from one of our favorite online butchers.\n",

      " HBO Max launched in May and has struggled to gain the same traction as Disney Plus. Angela Lang/CNET HBO Max will stream movies like The Matrix 4, Dune and all new Warner Bros. movies set for theatrical release next year, making them available to watch at no added cost online the same day as their debuts on the big screen. Each film will be on HBO Max, which costs $15 a month, for one month, and then the movies will leave the streaming service so that they're exclusively in theaters. The unprecedented move comes three weeks before Wonder Woman 1984, a mega-budget Warner Bros. movie, is set to stream on Max the same day it debuts in theaters in the US. Warner Bros. is essentially morphing its Wonder Woman release strategy into its new normal for the coming year. HBO Max is owned by telecom giant AT&T, through its WarnerMedia entertainment unit, which also operates the Warner Bros. studio. HBO Max executives dismissed the notion that this dramatic change in HBO Max's proposition to streaming customers would affect the service's ongoing talks with Roku. More than seven months since launch, HBO Max and Roku haven't reached a deal, which means Roku customers still can't access Max's app. Roku's streaming devices are some of the country's most popular gadgets to stream video on TVs. \"I don't think today's announcement changes anything dramatic\" in HBO Max's ongoing talks with Roku to reach a distribution deal, Andy Forssell, HBO Max's top tech executive, said in an interview Thursday. \"We already both had really strong imperatives to find a way to work together. So we have to go do that, and we'll get it done.\" WarnerMedia's decision Thursday marks the latest in a series of titanic changes in how movies make their way to you in the extraordinary circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic. Studios and cinemas have been experimenting with new release strategies that would've been inconceivable a year ago, especially for the most epically expensive films, like Wonder Woman, Dune and The Matrix. But Warner Bros. decision to release an entire year of its film slate online in this \"day-and-date\" model, when movies debut online and in theaters at the same time, is the most seismic shift yet.\n",

      " Then there's the support behind the two bills. The $908 billion proposal is backed by a group of Republican and Democratic senators, and has the conditional support of top US leaders, including President-elect Joe Biden and a growing number of Republicans. (House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer backed it as \"the basis for immediate\" negotiations.) McConnell's $500 \"skinny\" bill, however, failed to advance in the Senate, most recently in September. The last major category of differences comes down to the major programs the two bills support and how much money they might allocate as a bridge until another bill in 2021. Here are the major categories of funding currently under discussion. This story was updated with new information. A smaller proposal forwarded by Senators Sherrod Brown, Chuck Schumer and other Senate Democrats called the American Worker Holiday Relief Act would focus solely on extending the $600 unemployment benefits retroactively from September 2020 through October 2021. Extended Payroll Protection Program to help pay employees The Payroll Protection Program initially provided forgivable loans to small businesses to help cover worker wages and help keep employees on the books instead of laying them off.

      " Hyundai recalls 129,000 cars over fire and stalling risks It's back to the dealer for just under 129,000 Hyundai vehicles involved in a new recall to address stalling engines and a fire risk. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration published documents Hyundai filed with the government agency this week and said the Sonata, Santa Fe and Veloster are the vehicles in question this time. The Korean automaker continues to deal with fire risk issues in numerous cars from the past decade. Specifically, the 2011-2013 Sonata Hybrids, 2012 Santa Fe and 2015-2016 Veloster make up the recall population. Hyundai said in the documents that connecting rod bearings in each of the cars' engines could wear prematurely. If that happens, owners will have quite an engine knock problem. In other words, there's major damage occurring underneath the hood. Climb in the driver's seat If the damage persists, the cars may be at risk of stalling without warning to the driver. Drivers may also notice an oil pressure light illuminate and hear a persistent knocking noise from the engine. Although the risk of stalling increases the chance of a crash, another possible risk is an engine fire. If the connecting rod sustains more damage, there's the possibility it may puncture the engine block and let oil escape. Oil near the source of ignition and hot surfaces may cause a fire. The recall stems from a NHTSA investigation, following owner reports of fires. There's good and bad news surrounding this recall. The good news: Every car will be inspected, and if there are signs of bad connecting rod bearings, owners will receive a new engine free of charge. The bad news: Replacing an engine isn't a quick process. All cars with the problem will also receive new software that includes a Knock Sensor Detection System. Look for notices to mail out by the end of January.\n",

The outbreak poses an extra challenge to the country's health system as Africa's most populous nation deals with the Covid-19 pandemic, several concurrent disease outbreaks and a humanitarian crisis in the northeast, the WHO said. Nigeria has been battling successive yellow fever outbreaks since 2017. This latest outbreak was detected in November, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters in Geneva. \"As of November 24, the outbreak has been reported in five states in Nigeria: Delta, Enugu, Bauchi, Benue and Ebonyi,\" he said. \"A total of 530 suspected cases have been reported, including 48 that have been confirmed by lab testing.\n",

Ad Choices Online connection is perhaps the most important it has ever been. Between the growth of social media and in-person activities at an all-time low due to the coronavirus pandemic, people have turned to their screens for comfort and chat. And with that comes a whole new level of complications, as is seen in Catfish: The TV Show, which returned to MTV this week. The Dec. 1 episode kicked off a batch of eight new episodes, as hosts Nev Schulman and Kamie Crawford continue to help people figure out how real their online connections really are. 2020 also marks the tenth anniversary of the documentary of the same name that changed Schulman’s life and put the verb “catfish” in the dictionary. In honor of the milestone, the show will also launch “Catfish: The Podcast” on Dec. 9, as Schulman relives some of the most classic episodes from the show’s eight seasons so far. Schulman and Crawford spoke with Parade.com about what to expect from this new group of episodes, how much the pandemic has changed communication and connection, and Schulman’s feelings on his Dancing With the Stars runner-up finish. Nev, it’s been 10 years since the Catfish documentary premiered. Considering how much your life has changed since then, how do you look back on that vulnerable experience?Nev Schulman: The experience of getting “catfished” is funny for me. It brought us good fortune in letting us turn it into a film that was such a distinctive turning point in my life. In 2010, I didn’t know exactly what I was going to do. I was a bit less focused and a little bit more concerned with my social life. Then all of a sudden, I was introduced to the world as this young man who had this experience and handled it with compassion and maturity. That’s what people knew me as, which was great because I don’t know that a lot of people would have described me that way initially. It’s been an amazing decade for me. I’ve had the opportunity to really develop that side of my personality and grow my empathy and compassion. Not just for other people, but for myself as well. I get to connect with so many people globally over this very relatable experience of searching for love in the digital age. It is crazy to think that it’s been ten years; it weirdly has gone by in a flash. Each episode, I can look back now and see myself and how I’ve changed. I’ve been just filled me with a tremendous amount of gratitude for the experience of this last decade.\n",

The first being the premiere episode, which takes a page from the John Wick movies when Mac and the team infiltrate the Grand Hotel, an international hideout for criminals that very much resembles Wick‘s Continental Hotel, to find a woman with vital information on Codex. “It was pretty awesome,” Till tells Parade.com in this exclusive interview. “One thing that we are first and foremost is an action show, in my opinion, and to be able to pay homage to the most action-y of action movies of our recent time, it was amazing. Levy Tran [Desi Nguyen] was definitely having a blast because she’s an action junkie. Everyone was loving that one.” Even though the first episode back is still dealing with Codex, it is definitely going to feature standalone stories, which is good to hear because it felt as if Codex was dealt its death blow in the Season 4 finale. “Codex is exactly what you would think they would be,” Till says. “Something that’s been broken down and beaten down and no longer organized, while there are still remnants of the old order around in the world. You’ll still hear whispers, but for the most part, they’ve been defeated. It doesn’t mean there aren’t characters at play that belong to those factions, but for the most part there will be a lot of standalone storylines that deal with individual characters and their backstories or their current stories.”\n",

      " Francesca’s, the women’s apparel and footwear retailer, has filed for bankruptcy with plans to emerge through a sale process. The company walked into its bankruptcy case in Delaware late Thursday with a letter of intent with investment firm TerraMar Capital, for either TerraMar or an affiliate to be its stalking horse bidder in a sale process as the case progresses, according to the retailer. The company also added that a “number of other parties” are also conducting due diligence on the sale prospect. In a statement, the retailer said it plans to execute a sale of its “core retail locations as well as its promising digital expansion and new brand launches.” The company, which last month said it plans to close 140 locations by Jan. 30, is entering the bankruptcy with 558 locations. As the retailer works to renegotiate rent during the bankruptcy process, it may close more stores, it said. Francesca’s has also entered the proceedings with an agreement from its lender Tiger Finance LLC for a $25 million debtor-in-possession loan that the court is expected to consider for customary approval at an initial hearing in the case. “Implementing this process allows Francesca’s to address our lease obligations and seek a new investor that can see Francesca’s into the future,” said Andrew Clarke, the retailer’s chief executive officer. “We are excited by the potential partnership with TerraMar and we share their belief in the future of the business. In addition, a number of other parties are currently engaged in the due diligence process to become the owner of a new and revitalized Francesca’s,” Clarke said.\n",

      " An inexpensive valuation and a solid dividend yield round out the positive picture. Article Thesis Merck (MRK) is one of the largest pharma companies in the world, yet it is surprisingly underfollowed. The company owns one of the largest and most promising drugs in the world, Keytruda, which will generate huge sales growth in the foreseeable future. Shares are not expensive, offer a solid dividend yield, and they recently got a strong value endorsement as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B) entered a billion-dollar position in the company. Source: StockRover Merck trades relatively in-line with other large-cap pharma and biotech companies, trading at an overall inexpensive valuation while offering a yield that is substantially higher than that of the broad market. Strong Growth Outlook In the biotech and pharma industry, growth depends on the relative attractiveness of the drug portfolio of each company to a large degree. Those companies with young portfolios that do not face a patent cliff anytime soon are generally better positioned for the future, while those that face a meaningful number of losses of exclusivity (LOEs) may have bigger problems in growing their revenues. The effectiveness of the company's drugs matters a lot as well, of course, and last but not least, those drugs that target bigger indications have higher earnings potential. One of the best drugs in the world, based on these factors, is Keytruda (pembrolizumab). This monoclonal antibody is used to treat a range of tumors, including lung cancers, melanoma, and colorectal cancers. Oncology is one of the biggest segments of the pharma industry, with forecasted revenues of $180 billion in 2025, thus being active in this space means that there is a huge addressable market. Keytruda can be used to treat a range of indications, which means that its revenue generation potential is not limited to one sub-segment of the market. The indications Keytruda can be prescribed for include lung cancers (NSCLC and SCLC), which are one of the biggest indications in the oncology space. The NSCLC market alone is easily generating more than a dozen billion dollars a year in revenue, and Keytruda can be used for the treatment of other cancers on top of that. Keytruda generated revenues of $3.7 billion during the most recent quarter or ~$15 billion annualized. When we factor in that Q3 was impacted by the pandemic, we can assume that Keytruda's sales potential is even higher than that. Some people avoided visiting their doctors, which resulted in fewer cancer screenings, and thus fewer treatment starts compared to normal times. Once the pandemic has ended, cancer screenings will likely rebound, and Keytruda and other cancer drugs could see even higher revenues. Even though recent quarters were negatively impacted by the pandemic, Keytruda still generated revenue growth of more than 20% during Q3 on a year over year basis.\n",

      " The boutique, located on Cortina's central Corso Italia, will open by the end of the year. ON THE EDGE: Even if the upcoming winter holidays won’t include any ski activities, given the restrictions this month announced by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, which include the complete closure of ski runs until Jan. 7, those spending vacations in Cortina will be able to visit the Louis Vuitton store, opening by the end of December. The first shop of the luxury fashion house to open in an Italian ski resort, it will carry Louis Vuitton men’s and women’s ready-to-wear and accessories collections, as well as jewelry pieces, watches, fragrances and travel sets. Located in Cortina’s central Corso Italia, the store occupies a space that was previously the men’s boutique Franz Kraler, which still owns the location. Kraler operates two other multibrand shops in Cortina, as well as units in Dobbiaco and Bolzano. Last year, Kraler created a partnership with Dior to inaugurate that brand’s store in Cortina. The two-level Vuitton boutique has a cozy atmosphere heightened by the extensive use of wood. Vintage Italian furniture pieces from the Fifties and the Seventies will decorate the space, along with a range of works by several artists, including Edoardo Modenese and Russel Frampton. This is Vuitton’s 22nd store in Italy and the fourth in the Veneto region, which also houses the brand’s Manufacture de Souliers footwear atelier. Louis Vuitton is already present in other ski resorts including Courchevel in France; Crans-Montana, Gstaad and St. Moritz in Switzerland, as well as Aspen in Colorado.\n",

      " The Business of the Cracker Barrel Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. operates casual dining restaurants across 663 locations in the United States. CBRL restaurants feature “home-style country cooking” (2020 10-k) in an environment they describe as “rustic old country” design. Every store features a stone fireplace, covered patio, and antique-style furnishings. Cracker Barrel owns all of its restaurants; it does not currently franchise any locations(under the Cracker Barrel Brand) and doesn’t have any plans to start. Cracker Barrel also owns 35 breakfast and lunch fast-casual locations that operate under the Maple Street Biscuit Banner. In addition to the 35 owned locations, it also franchises 6 additional locations. All locations are located in the US. While the company has been consistent about opening new locations, averaging 5-10 per year since 2015, new locations represent growth of less than 1%/yr of their existing store base looking back over the same period. As you will read over the following paragraphs, growth is not a strong suit of Cracker Barrel. A Quick Look at the Competitive Landscape Restaurants in the casual dining space have been growing consistently for years, setting aside the recent pandemic. Below I’ve prepared a chart plotting the aggregate revenue from the primary casual dining players (*see below) against the revenue of Cracker Barrel. Cracker Barrel is on a different scale than the industry number, but you can clearly see that Cracker Barrel has been growing more slowly than the industry over the past 15 years. If you prefer numbers to pictures - since 2004 Cracker Barrel has grown its quarterly revenue by 2.0% vs. the segment at 5.0% (excluding results in 2020 due to COVID-19)\n",

      " In a game-changing move on Thursday, Warner Bros. revealed it will release its entire 2021 roster simultaneously in theaters AND on HBO Max. This follows the similar 'Wonder Woman 1984' strategy shift news from the other week which also caught off the entertainment industry off guard. Investors and analysts are waiting to see how HBO Max’s chief rivals may respond in kind, specifically Netflix and Disney+ which until now were the unquestioned frontrunners in the field. Movie theaters were understandably stunned by the news with Cinemark taking a calmer approach than AMC which made its feelings about the deal quite clear. HBO Max and AT&T went from defense to offense in one swift move with a bold daring play that we likely won’t know the full results of for some time (if ever).

      " We were initially intrigued by Regis Corp.'s (NYSE:RGS) aspiration to become a fully-franchised business model. After conducting our research, we determined RGS was actually overvalued. We observed the following key events at RGS, which contributed to our conclusion that RGS was not investable: 1) earnings forecast that we believe was unreachable and very hypothetical, 2) RGS’ proceeds per salon plummeted, 3) RGS’ organic franchise unit growth proved non-existent, 4) key executives departed from RGS, 5) RGS’ leverage levels increased, 6) sellside estimates proved wildly inaccurate/bullish, and 7) the macro environment deteriorated. However, we now believe that RGS’ equity is likely worthless. RGS’ shares had fallen from >$20/share in Q419 to ~$5/share in Q420, but have recently participated in the Russell 2000’s indiscriminate rally. With RGS’ shares currently priced at ~$10/share, we have significant conviction in our recommendation. For background, our fundamental research process has occurred over a multi-year period and includes our own primary diligence, conversations with RGS’ management, in-depth financial analysis, and more. In this brief note, we highlight the key pillars of our short thesis. 1. Even Before CV19, RGS Was Struggling - RGS has been and may continue to be a secularly challenged business. From 3Q16 to 2Q20 (Pre-CV19), RGS’ same store sales (“SSS”) declined by an average of 50 bps per quarter (or 2% annually). Traffic declines were far worse, but they were partially offset by higher priced haircuts, which is likely unsustainable in this difficult economic environment. RGS’ secular challenges will become more evident to investors once the lowest quality, company-owned salons are fully transitioned to the franchise segment. While the low-quality, company-owned salons will not appear in same-store franchise metrics for >12 months, they will appear in 2021. Their inclusion will likely act as a notable drag on the franchise segment’s same-store results. For those who doubt that recent (and remaining) company-owned salons are lower quality: notice that proceeds per transitioned company-owned salon have declined from > $100K to < $30K and RGS believes proceeds per salon will continue to fall. 2. Post-CV19 Pent-Up Demand Is Very Unlikely – RGS’ earnings call indicates pent-up demand only persisted for one week after each salon reopened. The exact quote from the Q121 earnings call is: “We saw an initial reopening surge lasting about a week post reopen…” As a value-focused salon, many RGS customers are ‘blue collar’ workers who have already returned to work. Their return to work has prevented hair growth to outrageous lengths – thereby reducing any forthcoming pent-up demand event. Meanwhile, many ‘white-collar’ workers will likely be working remotely post-CV19, which will structurally reduce haircut demand. In RGS’ Former CEO’s own words (on the August 2020 earnings call): “Most offices and headquarter buildings are still closed around the nation. And I think people are Zooming and Zoom seems to be a little more casual, and people aren't quite as well-groomed as they were when they went to an office.” Commercial real estate firm – Jones Lang LaSalle – estimates ~25% of employees may never return to the office, which will likely create a structural reduction in the amount of ‘well-groomed’ people, and thus reduce haircut demand. 3. RGS Faces A Potential Liquidity Crunch – On the most recent earnings call, RGS’ CFO explained: “We believe our largest uses of cash will occur in the first half of this year with cash utilization improving in the back half of the fiscal year.” Said differently, RGS will continue burning cash at a very elevated level ($30 mm+) in Q221 and continue to burn cash during 2H21 too. RGS’ lack of additional liquidity, at < $100 mm, should be an alarming dynamic to both RGS’ Management and shareholders. On the August earnings call, Former CEO Sawyer said, “We're not seeing the kind of recovery that we had hoped for.” If RGS’ Former CEO was not pleased with the recovery in August, it seems logical to assume that the cash flow generation may prove worse than Management expects, given that the U.S. set daily record for CV19 deaths, cases, and hospitalizations just yesterday. While vaccines are forthcoming, we think investors fail to appreciate that any deterioration in RGS’ near-term fundamentals will likely increase the probability of a liquidity crunch. 4. Sellside Analyst Lacks Credibility & Publish Factual Inaccuracies – The investment community may be less concerned about RGS’ liquidity issues due to erroneous comments by a sellside analyst. For example, a sellside analyst recently wrote, “Mgmt expects to use cash in Q2 and generate cash in 2H.” On the Q121 earnings call, RGS’ Management confirmed the sellside analyst’s comments are inaccurate by stating (as we highlighted above): “We believe our largest uses of cash will occur in the first half of this year with cash utilization improving in the back half of the fiscal year.” We encourage you to speak with RGS’ Management if you wish to further confirm Management’s expectation to burn cash during every quarter of FY21. The sellside analyst’s error should not be surprising to those who follow RGS closely. In prior estimates, this specific sellside analyst was incorrectly including non-recurring Gain on Sale proceeds in its EBITDA build. In 15 short months, this specific sellside analyst has reduced FY22 EBITDA from $63mm to $43mm and their price target from $24/share to $10/share, due to over-bullish assumptions and mismodeling RGS’ economics. 5. Key Executives Departing While New CEO Lacks Experience – After just two short years as CFO of RGS, Andrew Lacko quit in 2019 to join privately held ClubCorp. More recently, Chairman and CEO, Hugh Sawyer announced that he is retiring effective October 2020. Simply put, it is a ‘red flag’ to see both the CFO and CEO depart within one year. Just ask yourself: how many well-run businesses with optimistic outlooks have both the CFO & CEO depart? Also consider the head of RGS’ Franchise segment – Erik Bakken – is having his employment terminated later this year. Again, simple logic suggests that if the transition to a franchise model is going well, the man responsible for the franchise segment would be retained. Lastly, the most questionable change is the recent hire of new CEO Felipe Athayde. Athayde has 1) never worked in the hair care industry and 2) never been a CEO before. He was most recently the President of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, which ‘caught lightning in a bottle’ with its fried chicken sandwich. Our research indicates Athayde’s strategy is based on further pursuit of existing technology, brand, and marketing initiatives. Said differently, it seems Athayde is unlikely to drive materially positive change and he lacks the experience to manage RGS through the current crisis. 6. We Believe RGS’ Equity Is Worthless – We believe investors fail to appreciate two key dynamics: 1) RGS’ steady-state margins will remain under pressure if RGS continues covering marketing costs for franchisees; and, if RGS shifts this expense burden back to franchisees, it will cause franchisee economics to further deteriorate and 2) organic franchise unit growth has been non-existent despite franchisees facing requirements to open more salons. Both of these dynamics give us comfort that RGS’ earnings growth/recovery potential is limited. To quantify our view: RGS posted a ~$50 mm EBITDA loss in the LTM period after excluding non-recurring Gains on Sale. By June 2022, RGS will likely produce LTM results that reflect a post-vaccine world. We give RGS credit for completing its transition to a franchise model, reducing corporate overhead, and returning to ~breakeven EBITDA by FY22, which ends in June 2022. Then, after incorporating $20 mm of CapEx (which is currently running at ~$35 mm on an LTM basis) and $10 mm of Interest Expense, the implication is that RGS will continue to lose upwards of -$30 mm FCF per year. Keep in mind, while hemorrhaging $30 mm of cash PER YEAR sounds draconian, it actually represents a notable improvement from the ~$30 mm of cash RGS is currently burning PER QUARTER. Given RGS’ significant lease liabilities and growing revolver balance, we struggle to see how RGS’ equity will have any value. Simply put, it is unlikely that RGS’ business will generate cash flow anytime soon and the value of the company will continue to shift from the equity holders to the debtholders.\n",

Even the depressed sectors are poised to return to better levels in 2021 as the effects of the pandemic wear off. Then, there are several possible catalysts that can jumpstart profits beyond expectations. Reliance Steel & Aluminum (NYSE:RS) is the type of manufacturer that makes for a great long-term hold. The company is positioned in several great categories that will allow it to take advantage of several macroeconomic trends and lead to further growth. This company has proven over the past years and through the pandemic that it is top of class in regard to its ability to create steady profits and increase cash flows. Reliance Steel & Aluminum has some headwinds, however: its energy and aerospace businesses have both been put in a position to underperform due to the pandemic, but these could become catalysts as 2021 unfolds. There are some somewhat lower likelihood events that could jumpstart growth through 2021 even faster.

      " Elevator Pitch The company's 3Q 2020 revenue declined due to COVID-19, but there are signs of recovery suggesting that the worst is over. In addition, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts has outperformed its peers in the current challenging environment, due to its favorable revenue mix with a higher proportion of leisure-focused, franchised select-service hotels. Also, the opportunities for brand conversions, referring to the conversion of independent hotels to hotels under Wyndham Hotels & Resorts' brands, have increased during the coronavirus pandemic period. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts trades at consensus forward FY 2021 and FY 2022 EV/EBITDA multiples of 15.3 times and 12.6 times, respectively. The company's share price has increased by +170% from its trough of $21.59 on March 19, 2020, and its year-to-date share price decline is only -7%. This implies that positives associated with expectations of recovery in the hospitality industry, its favorable revenue mix, and an increase in opportunities for brand conversions have been priced in to a large extent. As such, I think that a Neutral rating for Wyndham Hotels & Resorts is justified, and I will only consider upgrading my rating on the stock if there is either a significant share price correction or the pace of recovery in leisure travel is much faster than expected. Company Description Spun off from its parent Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (WYN) in June 2018 as a separate listed entity, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts refers to itself as \"the world's largest hotel franchisor and leading hotel management services provider\" on its corporate website. The company has around 9,048 hotels with a total of 804,000 rooms located in 90 countries globally in its portfolio. COVID-19 Impact The hospitality industry is one of the key victims of the coronavirus pandemic, and it is no surprise that Wyndham Hotels & Resorts' financial performance has been adversely affected by COVID-19. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts reported the company's 3Q 2020 financial results on October 28, 2020, and its total revenue and RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) decreased by -40% YoY and -38% YoY to $337 million and $29.23, respectively in the third quarter of this year.\n",

This cash will allow for some debt reduction and the extension of the second lien loan by two years. Bolt-on acreage additions can be extremely profitable and low risk. At a little more than one times earnings, this stock is still very cheap even after the transaction. Sometimes, Mr. Market goes overboard when it comes to reactions to the news. Penn Virginia's (PVAC) share price was already below the per share earnings posted for the last fiscal year when the company announced a deal. Mr. Market panned the deal the minute it was announced. But acquiring acreage and cash in the current environment is nothing to be ashamed of. At some point, Mr. Market will realize the flexibility gained by this company.\n",

      " Sears Holdings: How To Buy 17 Dollars For 17 Cents Sears Holdings and the unsecured creditors committee have over $1.3 billion in cash listed as new equity/credit bid funds. According to tax expert Robert Willens, the net value of net operating losses and tax credits is worth at least $2.2 billion. Sears Holdings' common stock is currently worth at least $17 a share in cash, net operating losses, and unencumbered asset proceeds. Sears shareholders and bondholders should view ESL as its parent company and guarantor of the unsecured debt. This is another update article on Sears Holdings (OTCPK:SHLDQ). This is my eighth post-bankruptcy article, and because things are moving faster now, I will be writing about Sears on a regular basis. Because of the complexity of 368 tax reorganizations, and the difficulty in valuing the many non-retail businesses owned by Sears prior to bankruptcy, few investors realize that billions of dollars of value is left at the company and/or due to the company from the sale of the prepetition unencumbered assets. The challenge for most is getting past the drastic decline in stock price and getting to the company's value. In the end, valuation is all that matters. The stock price in 2012 or 2016 doesn't matter now.\n",

      " The market keeps pushing higher, despite an ongoing pandemic, with the major indices at all-time highs. I believe the market is pricing in a big stimulus plan from Congress, which means more gains will be difficult, even once it does get passed. Worse, we may not see stimulus until next year. Foreign buying of stocks has been extremely high recently. This often coincides with a drop in large-cap equities. Main Thesis The purpose of this article is to evaluate the Schwab U.S. Broad Market (SCHB) fund as an investment option at its current market price. SCHB is an ETF I cover for broad market exposure, as it sports a low expense ratio and holds over 2,400 stocks. As a result, I am maintaining a neutral rating on this fund, as I becoming increasingly concerned about the market's rising valuation. We are seeing COVID-19 cases spike again, in the U.S. and in Europe, yet stocks continue to push higher. Some of this is due to an expectation of stimulus from Congress, but it is still up in the air whether that will happen by year-end. Further, investor sentiment, among U.S. and foreign investors, is at historically high levels. This makes me think a correction may be forthcoming. Finally, while employment, economic growth, and trade numbers have all improved, they are all well below pre-crisis levels. This suggests the euphoric outlook for stocks is partly unjustified. Background First, a little background on SCHB. It is managed by Charles Schwab, and its stated objective is \"to track as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Broad Stock Market Index\". Currently, SCHB is trading at $88.65/share and yields 2.20% annually. I got cautious on the broader market, and SCHB by extension, over the summer. While my personal stance was to take some profits, I noted in my review of SCHB that there were signs the market could head higher still, and indeed, it has. In fact, the last five months have greatly exceeded my expectations, with SCHB rising over 18%, as shown below:\n",

      " PORTSMOUTH — Schools in Virginia honoring two U.S. presidents who sided with or praised the Confederacy are getting new names, along with an elementary that honored a superintendent who funneled money away from Black schools. The Portsmouth School Board voted 8-1 Thursday night to change the names of Woodrow Wilson High School, John Tyler Elementary School and James Hurst Elementary School, news outlets reported. Alumni and others had pushed for the changes following the global protests against racism and police brutality. Board member Lakeesha Atkinson said it's about \"righting the wrongs.\" Wilson, a progressive reformer who established the federal income tax, the central banking system and was a leading architect of the League of Nations, was also the first Southerner to serve as president since the Civil War. A segregationist Democrat, he wrote a history textbook praising the Confederacy and the Ku Klux Klan, and worked to keep Black students out while serving as Princeton University's president. The school that bears the 28th president's name in Portsmouth will be called Manor High School beginning next July, returning to the name it had before a merger with another school named after Wilson in the 1990s, WAVY-TV reported. Waterview Elementary is the new name of the school named for John Tyler, the 10th president, who later sided with the Confederacy and was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives shortly before his death in 1862. The school honoring James Hurst, who was Norfolk County Schools superintendent in the early to mid 20th century, will be changed to Cradock Elementary, after the school's historic neighborhood. Hurst's budgets funneled money to white schools over Black schools, according to the Virginia Department of Historic Resources.\n",

      " What does that mean? And why is Samsung killing its money-making powerhouse of a phone that millions of people love? The Note did not make sense as a separate product anymore Back when the Galaxy Note first launched in 2011, a year so far back in the past it seems like the dark ages in technology years, the phone was truly innovative. And I don't mean innovative in a one-more-camera sort of way, but innovative in a way that seeing it first-hand was a shock. During those times when iPhones had 3.5-inch screens (shout out to the OG iPhone crew that remembers), the Note changed the equation with a massive, 5.3-inch display. We ourselves were no different in our reaction: we were shocked and our own Rado exclaimed in the OG Galaxy Note review that \"some people with extraordinarily large hands may have a chance of finding it okay, but those cases will be extremely rare\". We were actually split in the office on this then new design, but it was certainly an unusual sighting for everyone, and boy did time prove us wrong on that review. But you learn from your mistakes, and along with millions of people, most of us also adapted to larger screen phones and these days many of us love having that option. Phones these days are actually much bigger and heavier. But fast forward to current time, 2020, and you have to be extremely knowledgeable to know the minuscule differences in specifications between a Galaxy S20 Ultra and a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. Except the S Pen and the slightly different design, these phones are extremely similar and there is really nothing substantial separating the Note from the Galaxy S series these days, like there used to be in the past. The Note has become a strange re-make of the Galaxy S series, just with an S Pen and a slightly different design, and it makes far less sense as a separate product anymore. But what about the S Pen? At the same time, the S Pen remains a feature that many people appreciate. Artists, architects, engineers, and just casual users, we've seen different people use and love the S Pen stylus for its precise control and fun features.\n",

      " WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden said Thursday that he will ask Americans to commit to 100 days of wearing masks as one of his first acts as president, stopping just short of the nationwide mandate he's pushed before to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The move marks a notable shift from President Donald Trump, whose own skepticism of mask-wearing has contributed to a politicization of the issue. That's made many people reticent to embrace a practice that public health experts say is one of the easiest ways to manage the pandemic, which has killed more than 275,000 Americans. The president-elect has frequently emphasized mask-wearing as a “patriotic duty\" and during the campaign floated the idea of instituting a nationwide mask mandate, which he later acknowledged would be beyond the ability of the president to enforce. Speaking with CNN's Jake Tapper, Biden said he would make the request of Americans on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20. “On the first day I'm inaugurated, I'm going to ask the public for 100 days to mask. Just 100 days to mask — not forever, just 100 days. And I think we'll see a significant reduction” in the virus, Biden said. The president-elect reiterated his call for lawmakers on Capitol Hill to pass a coronavirus aid bill and expressed support for a $900 billion compromise bill that a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced this week. “That would be a good start. It's not enough,” he said, adding, “I'm going to need to ask for more help.”\n",

Raising sales volumes to compensate for the low margins has become necessary. This has incentivized mergers and acquisitions in the industry. Investing in UAN has significant tax implications that investors should know about. Investment thesis The nitrogen fertilizers industry is consolidating. Increasing market share and sales volumes has become a necessity for survival, to compensate for the low margins. The rising M&A activity increases the exit opportunities and potential gain to investors. Still and all, CVR Partners' (NYSE:UAN) conflict of interest with Carl Icahn might discourage third-parties from acquiring a majority interest in the company.

      " Connor Crabtree has spent a lot of time at the University of Richmond’s Queally Athletics Center since it opened in October, but not involved in practices. The $15 million basketball-support facility includes an underwater treadmill on which Crabtree, a 6-foot-6 redshirt sophomore transfer from Tulane, has often run. Crabtree redshirted at UR last season after starting 15 games and averaging 7.1 points as a Tulane freshman. Late during that season at Tulane, he began experiencing pain in both hips. Determination that surgery would be required on each hip to address impingements came at about the same time Crabtree decided he would leave Tulane following a 4-27 season (0-18 American Athletic Conference). While redshirting at UR, Crabtree did not practice. He recovered, requiring crutches for about a month-and-a-half of his first school year at Richmond. During the spring, Crabtree forecast he’d be ready for the Spiders’ opener. Though that was delayed by about two weeks by the pandemic, he was not available. “I’ve been making some really good progress. I’m sure like many people, and me as well, I thought by now I would say I’ve played a couple of games already,” Crabtree said Thursday. “Unfortunately, not.” According to Crabtree, UR’s medical and athletic training staff, want him to experience a full recovery that allows him to compete without risking re-injury to his hips, or related areas. If there is a silver lining to Richmond’s program being stalled by positive COVID-19 cases and contact tracing, it’s that Crabtree has missed only two games. Three UR games have been called off by COVID, the opener vs. Detroit Mercy (positive test in Titans’ program), as well as Wednesday’s date at Charleston and Richmond’s Saturday home-opener vs. Furman.\n",

      " Mere days after Qualcomm unveiled the curiously named Snapdragon 888 sequel to the state-of-the-art Snapdragon 865 processor found under the hood of the vast majority of high-end Android smartphones released in 2020, one of the first-ever Galaxy S21 benchmarks appears to have cropped up online. In case you're wondering, that model number was widely believed to correspond to an \"international\" Galaxy S21+, while the SM-G991U clearly follows in the footsteps of the SM-G981U, aka the unlocked US Galaxy S20 5G. Meet the US Samsung Galaxy S21 5G Yes, ladies and gents, that is almost certainly what we're looking at here. Specifically, an entry-level configuration of the \"regular-sized\" S21 with 8 gigs of RAM (less than 7 of which will apparently be user-accessible), and presumably, 128 gigs of internal storage space. New Galaxy S21 5G benchmark More importantly, we're definitely looking at a Snapdragon 888-powered handset (motherboard \"lahaina\") capable of producing... some fairly modest single and multi-core performance scores, at least for the time being. We're talking a slightly higher single-core result than what the Snapdragon 865-powered Galaxy S20 5G normally delivers, as well as largely unchanged multi-core speed. Granted, we're still a couple of months or so away from the commercial debut of the Galaxy S21 family, and a lot of optimization work could happen between now and then, but it's certainly a little worrisome that these results are also extremely similar to the aforementioned S21+ benchmark from several months back.\n",

      " Some context If you have been reading articles here on Seeking Alpha for some time, you may have stumbled upon investing ideas titled as \"The more it falls, the more I buy,\" or something of a similar nature. Stocks can decline for various reasons, not always related to bad news or weak performance. Hence, investors may double down on such discounts, adding to their positions as their favorite equities gradually become cheaper. However, there is another scenario. That is, one keeps on buying a stock despite shares rallying higher by the day. This is the case with StoneCo (STNE), which I have been bullish on for quite some time now. I initially published an article in April urging investors to consider the stock's massive return potential. Since then, shares have hugely outperformed the overall market, returning more than 230%. Despite the rally and valuation expansion, I shared a follow-up article two months ago, encouraging investors who stayed on the sidelines to not think as if they had missed the rally, as there were more gains to be made ahead. Indeed, shares have rallied by more than 27% over this short period, fueled by StoneCo's spectacular earnings earlier in October. If you took action post-reading any of these two articles, you are probably already happy with your returns. The question that arises now, however, is whether there is more fuel to push shares higher and whether investors who already hold StoneCo or not should double down or initiate a position, respectively, at the stock's new all-time high levels.

      " Samsung is gearing up to announce not one or two like in 2019 and 2020, but three foldable phone types in 2021, according to an UBI Research analysis. It released the OG Galaxy Fold in 2019, reworked it entirely in 2020 with the Z Fold 2, and then added the horizontal clamshell folder of the Z Flip line. So far, so good, the Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 2 are in the pipeline, that much we could've guessed, too. What's the new foldable phone that Samsung will be launching in 2021 then? The OLED display research firm says it will be none other than the Galaxy Z Fold Lite that was supposedly out of the game, and it will be released as early as next quarter, perhaps after the Galaxy S21 seriesUnpacked announcement. Makes a lot of sense, as a cheaper Fold Lite will ensure that Samsung has a bendy phone in every segment - a verticle folder, a horizontal folder, and an affordable folder - to take up every nook and cranny in that particular market niche before others. One thing immediately comes into focus - the size difference of the external displays. The large 6\"+ panel of the Z Fold 2 will give way to a smaller window to the world, as Samsung is striving to make its foldable phones thinner and lighter. Also, what's the point of having a big-screen foldable phone if you are mainly using the external screen anyway? The Z Flip 2, on the other hand, is going into the opposite direction. After taking flack from users for the puny 1\" outside screen of the clamshell, Samsung is now preparing to slap a more useful 3\" ticker on the outside. As far as specs go, we can reasonably expect Snapdragon 888 processors, integrated 5G connectivity, improved cameras, plenty of storage, and decent battery sizes. Bi-folding Galaxy Z-series phones are in Samsung's pipeline We recently spotted some interesting new transparent, rollable, and foldable phone designs that Samsung Display posted in a series on its own blog, but chalked those off as wishful thinking of the designer team.\n",

At a valuation of $25.4 billion, DoorDash earns our Unattractive rating and would be the most ridiculous IPO of 2020. It's not a good idea to invest in businesses that have no moat, no profits in the best-possible environment, and competition that can offer the same service for free. Is it a coincidence that DoorDash (DASH) filed for its IPO so soon after vaccines for COVID-19 were announced? We think DoorDash’s current investors and bankers recognize that the window of opportunity to IPO this business closes quickly when the threat of COVID-19 driven lockdowns no longer drives growth in food delivery demand. With the latest S-1 filed, DoorDash is aiming for a price range of $75-$85, which could give the firm a valuation of $23.8 billion to $27.0 billion ($25.4 billion midpoint). Such a valuation would be well above the firm’s last private valuation of $16 billion. At a valuation of $25.4 billion, DoorDash earns our Unattractive rating and would be the most ridiculous IPO of 2020. We think this proposed public equity offering holds no value, $0, beyond bailing out private investors before unsuspecting public investors realize the business is not viable in its current form. This IPO reminds us of WeWork’s attempted IPO, which we called The Most Ridiculous IPO of 2019, because DoorDash’s business is similarly disadvantaged.

      " I provide metrics relating current and historic share valuation to revenues and profits. There is much about Caterpillar (CAT) to attract investors. Caterpillar is a Dividend Aristocrat with 27 consecutive years of dividend increases to its credit. The company is the largest construction and mining equipment manufacturer in the world. Now that more than half of the sales originate outside of North America, the firm can boast of a global footprint. With over 2 million pieces of equipment in operation and over a million of those operating with telematics, the firm has a client base that provides considerable recurring revenue. Nonetheless, the company is a cyclical stock, and the pandemic creates headwinds that buffet the shares. Demand in mining and construction is depressed due to COVID, and related industries cut capex accordingly. The third-party dealers selling and servicing CAT's wares responded by slashing inventories. That trend is likely to continue, at least over the short term. Meanwhile, CAT's revenues and profits have plummeted while the company's own inventory levels remain high.

If there was \"good\" news, it was that those stats were an improvement over the previous quarter's 31% revenue decline and 70% plummet in profits.\n",

      " Community Bank: Earnings Unlikely To Return To Pre-Pandemic Level Soon The margin will likely continue to face pressure from the replacement and refinancing of fixed-rate loans. Loan growth will likely remain low because the demand for credit in the commercial segment will remain muted and Paycheck Protection Program loans will get forgiven. CBU depends on merger and acquisition activity for growth. Acquisitions in the current environment appear unlikely. CBU is currently offering a low dividend yield and limited price upside. Earnings of Community Bank System, Inc. (NYSE: CBU) will likely be unable to return to pre-pandemic levels in this year or 2021. The margin will likely decline further in the coming quarters due to pressure on yields. Additionally, normalization of mortgage banking revenues will pressurize earnings. Meanwhile, loan growth will likely be lower than usual because of lackluster commercial credit demand, forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program loans, and little chance of merger and acquisition activity. CBU has historically relied on acquisitions for growth. Overall, I’m expecting CBU to report earnings of $3.03 per share in 2020, down 6% year-over-year. Further, I’m expecting the company to report earnings of $3.01 per share in 2021. The June 2021 target price suggests a limited upside from the current market price, and the dividend yield is low; therefore, I’m adopting a neutral rating on CBU.\n",

Trading View Price and Trading Strategy Technically, the bears are in control. As long as the natural gas price (Jan. contract) remains below 2.553, the short-term (technical) trading bias will remain bearish. A break below 2.463, could cause a fall into the 2.450-2.405 range. A confident break above 2.553 could lead to a gain into the 2.586-2.689 range. Fundamentally, natural gas is very cheap (vs. projected supply-demand balance and also relative to its close substitutes or alternatives – notably, coal and oil). The contrast with other markets is even more stark. U.S natural gas market seems to be the only natural gas market in the world where prices are just unable to rise (see the chart below).

However, the company is in the midst of a digital transformation that should improve its bottom line by as much as 1,200 basis points per truck. With spot pricing above contract pricing for the first time in seven quarters and insider buying, U.S. Xpress merited a deeper dive. A full investment analysis is highlighted in the paragraphs below. Today, we take a look at a transportation and logistics concern that should benefit from the rebound in economic activity as the country continues to recover from the Covid-19 meltdown. It also has some recent insider buying. A full analysis follows below. Company Overview: Headquartered in Chattanooga, Tennessee, U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc. (USX) is the fifth-largest asset-backed truckload carrier in the U.S., boasting a fleet of ~6,500 tractors and ~13,500 trailers, including ~1,900 tractors provided by independent contractors. Its primary geographic focus is the Eastern U.S., and its company-owned tractors have an average age of 1.6 years.

A look at some of the \"global reset\" chatter, and geopolitical risks that investors can monitor for asset allocation. Since autumn of 2019, I’ve been bearish on the dollar, meaning I have a longish-term outlook towards a weaker dollar. This view began forming when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in summer 2019, and then the view solidified with a catalyst after an overnight repo rate spike in September 2019 forced the Fed to begin supplying repo liquidity. In my October 2, 2019 article, “The Most Crowded Trade“, I said to look for a weaker dollar in 2020, and also stated that the Fed would likely start expanding its balance sheet by buying Treasuries in 2020 or perhaps as early as that quarter in 2019 due to oversupply.

Both No 10 and the European Commission declined to confirm whether talks are likely to continue into the weekend after reports surfaced that the European Union’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier would remain in London, having initially planned to travel back to Brussels on Friday. Despite optimism in the week that the prospect of a deal was on the horizon, progress appeared to stall on Thursday, with a senior UK Government source claiming Brussels was calling for fresh concessions at the 11th hour and that the prospect of an agreement was “receding”.

Our 'EV penetration tracker' shows the Chinese passenger EV market's steep growth trajectory, while XPEV is well-positioned to pick the ripening fruit in the space. The mid-to-long-term outlook seems rather harsh, with the market competition intensifying and the growing uncertainty of the company's RORC.

The most TSLA-like carmaker in China… Xiaopeng He, XPeng's CEO and founder, incorporated the company in 2014. Since then, he has been sailing the market waves in the same segment with arguably the most famous auto stock – TSLA. He has selected a management crew comprising professionals from ZTE, TSLA, JP Morgan and Volkswagen, among other tech-heavy corporations, top automakers and global professional services companies. XPEV launched its SUV G3 in 2018 with the price starting from CNY 147,000 and an NEDC range of at least 520 km. In 2020, the carmaker rolled out its sedan P7, with the price and NEDC range starting from CNY 230,000 and 562 km respectively. P7 adopts a streamlined design, taking on TSLA's Model 3 in the Chinese market. … is dedicated to R&D… Another characteristic shared by XPeng is its intention to provide a \"revolutionary experience to tech-savvy consumers through full self-driving and in-car entertainment services.\" It concentrates on R&D, adopting full-stack solutions. To achieve self-reliance, XPEV has been pouring colossal money into the innovation push. In the past twelve months, it spent USD 290 million, or 53% of the revenue of USD 551 million, on R&D.\n",

      " Banerjee on Friday issued a stern warning against \"anti-party activities\" and said TMC leaders in touch with the opposition are free to quit the ruling party in the state. Although the TMC supremo did not take any name, party sources said that her jibe was at disgruntled leader Suvendu Adhikari, who has recently resigned from her cabinet, and a few other MLAs who have spoken out against the party top brass. \"At a party meeting held during the day, Banerjee said that if one leader quits the party, she can create a lakh more such leaders,\" a senior TMC leader said on condition of anonymity. She also spoke with Suvendu Adhikari's father and Purba Medinipur TMC chief and Kanthi MP Sisir Adhikari and asked him to rein in anti-party activities and sack the \"traitors\" from the party's district unit. \"Sisir da said he will look into it,\" the TMC leader said. Banerjee extended her support to the farmers' agitation in north India against the new farm laws and asked the TMC's farmers' wing to stage a three-day sit-in demonstration in front of the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in central Kolkata from December 8. \"She said that anti-party activities will not be tolerated and those in touch with the opposition camp are free to leave the party.\n",

      " The Congress on Friday raised with the government issues concerning the availability of a prospective COVID vaccine at the grassroots level in the country with party leader Rahul Gandhi asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi to clarify when every Indian will get it. The Congress also asked what would happen to the BJP's poll promise in Bihar of providing the coronavirus vaccine free of cost to every person in the state. \"In today's all-party meeting, we hope the PM clarifies when will every Indian get a free Covid vaccine,\" Gandhi said on Twitter ahead of the all-party meeting chaired by the Prime Minister to discuss the COVID-19 situation. At the virtual all-party meeting, to which floor leaders of various parties in Parliament were invited by the government, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said COVID-like pandemics can pose a threat to the country's internal security and policy makers should address this challenge. The senior Congress leader while addressing the meeting said the country should be well placed to get vaccines at affordable prices and at an early stage and distribute them up to the grassroots level. Prime Minister Modi said at the meeting that experts believe the wait for a COVID-19 vaccine will not be long and it may be ready in a few weeks, asserting that the vaccination drive in India will begin as soon as scientists give the nod. Modi said healthcare workers involved in treating COVID-19 patients, frontline workers including police personnel and municipal staff, and old people suffering from serious conditions would be inoculated on priority.\n",

      " China is the \"greatest threat\" to democracy and freedom since World War II and Beijing was preparing for confrontation with the US and intended to dominate the world \"economically, militarily and technologically\", according to America's top intelligence official. Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said China was growing its power by stealing US secrets and then replacing US firms in the market. The Trump administration has taken a hard line on China, imposing tariffs on Chinese goods and accusing Beijing of intellectual property theft. \"The intelligence is clear: Beijing intends to dominate the U.S. and the rest of the planet economically, militarily and technologically. Many of China's major public initiatives and prominent companies offer only a layer of camouflage to the activities of the Chinese Communist Party,\" according to Ratcliffe. The Trump administration's most senior intelligence official's stark warning was just the latest from senior administration officials about China's intentions, with some warning of possible military action in Asia and others pointing to unprecedented efforts to influence the incoming Biden administration. The op-ed comes as the Trump administration has recently taken several punitive measures against Beijing, sharply limiting visas for members of the ruling Communist Party of China and unveiling new sanctions on Chinese companies. The Trump administration also ordered China to close their consulate in Houston earlier this year due to allegations that Chinese diplomats at the mission were intimidating US citizens and carrying out espionage efforts.\n",

      " LONDON (Reuters) - Brent crude oil futures rose to just under $50 a barrel on Friday as major producers agreed on a compromise to increase output slightly from January but continue the bulk of existing supply curbs to cope with coronavirus-hit demand. Brent was up 53 cents at $49.24 a barrel by 1034 GMT after hitting its highest since early March at $49.92. West Texas Intermediate rose 47 cents to $46.11 a barrel. Both benchmarks are set for a fifth straight week of gains. OPEC and Russia on Thursday agreed to ease deep oil output cuts from January by 500,000 barrels per day with further as yet undefined increases on a monthly basis, failing to reach a compromise on a broader policy for the rest of 2021. OPEC+ had been expected to continue existing cuts until at least March, after backing down from plans to raise output by 2 million bpd. The increase means the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia, a group known as OPEC+, are set to reduce production by 7.2 million bpd, or 7% of global demand from January, compared with current cuts of 7.7 million bpd. The deal will ensure declining crude inventories through the first quarter, said SEB analyst Bjarne Schieldrop. \"Oil demand is likely to rebound strongly in 2021 along with the roll-out of vaccines. There are good reasons to be bullish for oil,\" he said.\n",

      " Taking cue from the Supreme Court initiative on protecting environment, different high courts in the country have started accepting petitions and affidavits on A4 size paper printed on both sides instead of the bigger legal sheets, officials said. Chief Justice of India S A Bobde, who is hearing different PILs related to environment, has taken a series of steps both on the Judicial as well as on the administrative side at the Supreme Court which will result in protecting thousands of trees and huge amounts of water, they said. From April 1, 2020, for judicial filings in the top court, all the stakeholders are required to use A4 size paper, to be printed on both the sides. The officials at the top court said that this measure alone is estimated to save around 1.5 crore A4 sheets of paper per year. With an average fresh filing of 41,010 matters (average of fresh filing for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019) with an average paper book size of 200 pages (800 pages for 4 paper books), with both side printing it is a conservative estimate that around 1.5 crore pages will be saved in a year. Following the top court's initiative, different high courts including Calcutta, Karnataka, Sikkim, Tripura and recently Allahabad have adopted some of these environment friendly measures, the officials said. Following the decision to use A4 size paper, with one and half line spacing and reduced margins instead of earlier legal size paper for judicial filings, is estimated to save another 15 percent of paper usage that is around 45 lakh pages annually, they said.\n",

      " DAEJEON, Dec. 4 (Yonhap) -- A local court on Friday issued arrest warrants for government officials accused of deleting documents related to the controversial closure of the Wolsong-1 nuclear reactor. The Daejeon Central District Court granted the warrants against two officials from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, whose names were withheld, on charges of disturbing the state auditors' examination. However, the court rejected a request to issue an arrest warrant for another ministry official in connection with the case. They allegedly destroyed 444 files about the government's decision to terminate the operation of Wolsong-1, the country's second-oldest nuclear reactor, right before the Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) ordered the submission of the documents late last year. Among the deleted data, officials were able to recover only 324 files. The closure of Wolsong-1 has remained a hot-button topic in domestic politics since President Moon Jae-in decided in 2017 to decommission the reactor earlier than scheduled in line with his energy policy. The BAI earlier concluded that the shutdown decision was based on biased research, which undervalued the reactor's economic viability.\n",

      " Chef cooks up incredible gourmet meals using hotel room appliances A young English chef has become a TikTok sensation with videos in which he creates restaurant-level gourmet meals using hotel room appliances. Cornishman Jago Randles was quarantined for two weeks at the Gec Granville Suites Hotel in Vancouver after arriving in Canada to take on a new job at a ski resort in Whistler, British Columbia, reports Cornwall Live. Using everything from a coffee maker to his trusty iron, in his \"Isolation Kitchen\" series he whips up dishes such as poached eggs with hollandaise sauce and salmon with rice vermicelli and bok choy. His first video was only posted on November 22, but he's already amassed 3.7 million \"likes\" on the social media site, and also attracted the attention of the notoriously hard-to-please chef Gordon Ramsay. \"That looks like some decent food, certainly some of the best food I've seen in any hotel,\" concludes Ramsay in a video on his own TikTok. While Randles' meals look very, very palatable, not everyone has been impressed by his efforts.\n",

Bolton were also victorious in the Papa John's Trophy against Newcastle United's under-21s, with the only blight on their results book in November being defeat in the FA Cup at the hands of League One Crewe Alexandra.

      " Mining giant Glencore lays out climate plan as CEO retires BERLIN -- Mining giant Glencore said Friday that it aims to stop adding greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere by 2050. The Anglo-Swiss company, which is one of the world's biggest miners of coal, said it plans to cut emissions from all parts of its business by 40% in the next 15 years compared with 2019 levels, before going to ‘net zero’ by mid-century. The term net zero means Glencore will only emit as much carbon dioxide and other planet-warming gases as can be absorbed again through technological and natural means. Several countries and companies have recently pledged to aim for net zero by 2050 as part of global efforts to curb climate change. Scientists say man-made greenhouse gas emissions need to drop drastically in the coming decades in order to keep global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) as agreed in the 2015 Paris climate accord. Glencore said it aims to shrink its carbon footprint by reducing coal production, expanding its metals portfolio — including those needed for battery production — and boosting low emission technologies. But the company also said it expects fossil fuels to play an important role “for many years to come” and that it won't sell off its coal mines.\n",

United and City were both involved in European competitions in August, meaning they were given an extra week off at the start of this season to rest. It meant United's game against Burnley and City's match with Aston Villa, which were both scheduled for the opening round of matches, were postponed. There is currently no indication as to when the games will be played, with the matches not yet rescheduled, and Mourinho is frustrated after his Spurs side were forced to play four matches in the space of eight days across September and October. He said: \"It is very difficult to accept that four clubs have one match less than the others and I don’t even know when they’re going to play these matches which in every country would be impossible.\n",

      " Christmas with the Hobs will be streamed online from 12-31 December. This December, three Northumberland venues are teaming up with CaroleW Productions to create Christmas with the Hobs, a brand new festive animation made in Northumberland for audiences everywhere to experience at home, and in schools, hospitals and care homes. It's Christmas Eve at Nana's house and Tyler and Eliza are waiting for Dad to pick them up to start the celebrations. But when plans change, they must work together to create a Christmas to remember, with the help of their newfound friends, the Hobs! Join them as they discover what really makes Christmas special, with mishaps and mayhem along the way. Written by Becci Sharrock, Christmas with the Hobs is illustrated by Sheila Graber who animated the children's TV series Paddington in the 1980s, with original music by North East singer song writer Bridie Jackson. The cast are Joseph Casling, Jude Nelson, Lewis Jobson, Viktoria Kay and Jacqueline Phillips, who will also direct. Katy Taylor, Queen's Hall Arts Artistic Director said, \"We're delighted to be working in partnership with Alnwick Playhouse and Berwick Maltings to create a wonderful new animation for Christmas. This is the first time we've commissioned an animation and we are so lucky to be working with a fantastically talented team of artists and performers. All three venues in Northumberland were successful in our applications for emergency funding from Arts Council England last month and this has enabled us to try something new and make something truly magical for our audiences this Christmas. \"We know that freelance performers, technicians and artists have really struggled while venues have been closed, and many people have been unable to access government financial support so it's vital that we do our bit to help. Christmas with the Hobs gave us an opportunity to bring together North East arts professionals to create a magical Christmas gift from Northumberland. We hope you enjoy it!\" Becci Sharrock was inspired to start writing after her first experience of working in theatre, ushering on The Pitmen Painters at Live Theatre. Her first producing commission - Waiting for Angus - was a co-commission from Maltings Berwick, Theatre Royal Newcastle and ARC Stockton, through the Bridging the Gap programme. She has since worked with Northern Stage, Theatre Sans Frontières and New Writing North. She also runs the Hexham young writers' group in partnership with Queen's Hall Arts and Hexham Book Festival, which Joseph Casling who plays Tyler in the show took part in.\n",

Pep Guardiola has no new injury concerns for Manchester City's Premier League clash with Fulham on Saturday, but Sergio Aguero will not make his return from injury just yet. Aguero has missed City's last two games after suffering a setback on his recovery from the knee injury that he picked up at West Ham. He has only played 13 minutes since then, as a late substitute at Olympiacos, as Guardiola insists he will slowly ease Aguero back to full fitness. Ahead of the Fulham clash, which is followed by a dead rubber against Marseille in the Champions League, Guardiola had some good news on Aguero's condition, revealing that the striker has returned to training with his teammates.\n",

      " Pep Guardiola spoke to the media once again this afternoon to preview Manchester City's Premier League home fixture with Fulham. City will be looking to build on the 5-0 win over Burnley last weekend, which was followed by a goalless draw with Porto in the Champions League that secured their position as group winners with a game to spare. That gives Guardiola the chance to recall some big hitters against Fulham before resting them for the clash with Marseille on Wednesday. Fulham beat Leicester to record their first away win on Monday, and although they have the worst defensive record in the Premier League, Scott Parker's men will arrive at the Etihad with renewed confidence and nothing to lose. So City must ensure they are professional, field a strong team, and secure the three points to continue to climb back up the league. Guardiola offered a fitness update on his squad, with Sergio Aguero the only outstanding injury concern after missing the last two games with discomfort in his knee on his return from his latest lay-off.

Manchester United will be looking to bounce back from their defeat by Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday night when they travel to the London Stadium to take on West Ham. United are in good domestic form after successive wins over Everton, West Brom and Southampton, and victory over West Ham would move them to within two points of the top of the table - for a few hours at least. Donny van de Beek is expected to come back into United's line-up after the Dutchman came off the bench against PSG earlier in the week. He lined up alongside Fred and Bruno Fernandes in the recent wins over Istanbul Basaksehir and Saints, and that trio is likely to be reunited against David Moyes' side. Marcus Rashford's form on the right wing has been encouraging and he could remain there if he is deemed fit to to start after a shoulder complaint, while Edinson Cavani has given United a focal point up front. At the back, Luke Shaw's continued absence means Alex Telles remains without competition at left-back, while Aaron Wan-Bissaka is the obvious choice on the opposite flank. Rotation will be key and Axel Tuanzebe can expect game time in December, but it will be a surprise if Victor Lindelof doesn't line up alongside Harry Maguire.\n",

      " Government Employees Pension Fund backs scandal-ridden PIC The new head of Africa’s biggest pension fund is retreating from his predecessor’s threat to withdraw money from the Public Investment Corp, as he backs a turnaround at the scandal-plagued asset manager. That the former overseer of South Africa’s Government Employees Pension Fund is now at the helm of the state-owned PIC is also giving Musa Mabesa the confidence to entrust the bulk of its R1.9 trillion portfolio to the money manager. Mabesa, 37, took over from Abel Sithole last month as principal executive officer of the GEPF after Sithole moved to the PIC, which counts on the pension fund for the bulk of its assets. While Sithole had said shifting funds from the PIC to other managers was an option, Mabesa is opting to bolster scrutiny of the firm and give it time to rebuild trust. \"Diversifying who we give mandates to is a future discussion we can have,\" Mabesa said in an interview on Thursday. \"We have increased confidence in the PIC’s interim board - and we know Abel.\" A judicial inquiry last year exposed lapses in the PIC’s governance and political interference in its investment decisions, with a third of the recommendations aimed at the company’s management. The inquiry also highlighted the PIC’s reliance on the GEPF, which accounts for 86% of its funds under management, and oversees the retirement savings of more than 1.2 million civil servants. The filling of several high-ranking vacant posts at the PIC also “improves functioning and provides comfort to us,” Mabesa said. Before taking the top role at the fund, Mabesa was head of corporate services at the GEPF.\n",

De Ruyter says similarly, elected officials at municipalities must be held accountable to paying their bills to the utility. Not holding people to account opens the doors to a \"free for all\", and that's why Eskom has parted way with several staff, the power utility's CEO Andre de Ruyter has said. De Ruyter was on Friday speaking at a fundraising event hosted by the SA National Editors Forum (Sanef). The power utility, along with the Special Investigating Unit (SIU), earlier this year lodged a civil claim to recover R3.8 billion from former Eskom officials for breaching their fiduciary duties in allowing the power utility to suffer losses as funds were funneled to the Gupta family, on their watch.\n",

      " Early into the pandemic, drug makers around the world began a race to deliver a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine. On March 16, the first dose of US biotech firm Moderna’s vaccine candidate was administered in the US. On the same day, just hours earlier, the first dose of a Chinese Covid-19 vaccine was given to volunteers in Wuhan. This week, the UK became the first western country to authorize the widespread use of a vaccine developed by Pfizer and German firm BioNTech, after the firms shared final-stage trial data with its medicines regulator. The first jabs could be given to frontline medical workers as soon as next Monday (Dec. 7). In the intervening months, several of the companies furthest ahead in the effort to provide a vaccine have released preliminary data from late-stage trials of their vaccines’ efficacy and safety (none of the data is peer-reviewed yet). Meanwhile, Chinese vaccine makers haven’t released any data from this final stage of clinical trials, even though some of these vaccines are already being used on hundreds of thousands of people even outside of clinical trials. Overseas at least two countries have approved emergency use of at least one of China’s vaccines. But we may see some data and more widespread use of Chinese vaccines soon. On Friday (Dec. 4), Wang Junzhi, the deputy head of China’s task force on vaccine development, said at a briefing that China has 600 million doses ready to administer this year, and promised a “major announcement in the coming one to two weeks.” Wang’s remark came days after Sun Chunlan, China’s vice premier, gave instructions for Chinese drug makers to be prepared to mass-produce the shots during her visit to a major vaccine maker in Beijing. The rollout of China’s vaccines, like those out of the US and Europe, will have a major impact not only on the global efforts to stop the pandemic, but also on the international diplomatic landscape as Beijing promises developing countries priority access to its doses. Here’s where things stand on China’s vaccines, including what we know about their safety and efficacy, and how widely they have been administered so far. Two of the vaccines are being developed by the state-run China National Pharmaceutical Group, or Sinopharm, both via its subsidiary China National Biotec Group (CNBG). For one of the vaccines, known by the initials BBIBP-CorV, a Beijing unit of the subsidiary is working with China’s Center for Disease Control, while the other vaccine is being developed by a Wuhan unit.\n",

      " Christalla Amphlett (pictured), 22, was yesterday cleared of causing the death by dangerous driving, after her friend was killed in a crash in 2017 A driver whose friend died in a horror crash on the M1 hard shoulder has celebrated being cleared of causing death by dangerous driving with a bottle of champagne. Christalla Amphlett, now 22, has been filmed celebrating with friends after a jury found her not guilty of causing the death of her friend Chloe Palmer, 19. Ms Amphlett pumped her fists in the air while sitting in the back of a car as a friend said she was 'so proud', reported The Sun. In the early hours of November 25, 2017 Ms Amphlett stopped her Renault Twingo on the motorway, just south of Junction 6 at Bricket Wood in Hertfordshire, after a 17-minute-long argument with Ms Palmer broke out. The car, which had been stationary for a second time, was then hit by an Isuzu D-Max driven by Bradley Lane, who careered into the back of the vehicle. Ms Palmer, the rear off-side passenger, suffered a severe brain injury and died days later. Maisie O'Flynn, who was on the back seat nearside seat next to Chloe, received serious injuries, but survived the crash.\n",

      " The biggest acquisition of 2020 has put a spotlight on the business of collecting data about money. How much is that information worth? This week’s deal was a biggie: S&P Global’s $44 billion purchase of IHS Markit combines an old company with a relative newcomer, which, if approved by regulators, will create a data powerhouse. The former has its roots in the railroad age and is one of the world’s biggest credit-rating companies. The New York-based firm also sells market analytics and runs stock and energy indices. The latter, formed through a merger in 2016, is headquartered in London and operates fixed-income benchmarks, captures bond and derivatives prices, and has information on a range of industries. Some thinkers, like the editors at The Economist, have suggested that data is the oil of the 21st century. The idea is that digital information is the raw material for the modern economy, a resource global corporations will battle to control and refine for new products. “The valuations are focused around the idea that these market data venders—it’s an infinitely producible asset,” said Octavio Marenzi, CEO of capital markets management consultancy Opimas. “You can fill it a million times without any real additional cost. With banks and oil companies, that’s not the case. An oil company cannot sell the same barrel of oil more than once.” By several metrics, investors tend to value financial data companies more highly than other types of best-in-class companies in that sector, from trading firms and banks to money managers. Data companies usually come out ahead when you look at ratios of market value to sales (price to sales) and earnings (price to earnings). This suggests investors are more keen on firms like London Stock Exchange Group, the British market infrastructure company that’s acquiring data provider Refinitiv, and MSCI, an index operator. Put another way, stock buyers are more willing to buy companies that collect financial data than the ones that generate it. (Stock exchanges tend to make a large chunk of their money by selling trading data.) “S&P Global can sell its ratings data as many times as they would like,” Marenzi said. “It’s infinitely scalable at very low variable cost.” Market data companies have several advantages versus banks and other institutions. Companies that run a stock index or data terminal for traders attract less attention from government regulators than a systemically important bank does. Compliance with those rules can sap profits. While shares of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, have soared this year, the company faces fierce competition as money-management fees race to zero, causing margins to implode. At the same time, financial data companies like FactSet and IHS Markit don’t command the kind of sky-high valuations that tech giants like Amazon (with a PE ratio of about 93) do. Market-data vendors are relatively unsexy, and their revenues aren’t growing at nearly the rate of some of the consumer tech firms. Some companies, like Bloomberg, make a large chunk of their money providing data terminals to human traders, and those roles are increasingly being replaced by algorithms. If the data companies’ customers—the rest of the financial services industry—are under pressure, that makes it tough for the data providers to hike prices and find new clients.\n",

      " Bangladesh transported Rohingya refugees Friday on a naval vessel to the island of Bhashan Char. Feliz Solomon Bangladesh has begun relocating Rohingya refugees to a remote island off the country’s southeast coast, despite calls from human rights groups to halt the plan. Bangladesh’s commissioner on refugee issues, Mahbub Alam Talukder, said more than 1,000 Rohingya were taken to the island of Bhasan Char on Friday. They were moved from the country’s massive refugee camps that are home to around a million members of the persecuted community. Most of the refugees were forced to flee their native Myanmar, which borders Bangladesh, after a brutal Burmese military campaign in 2017. Bangladesh authorities developed the island of Bhasan Char, which wasn’t previously inhabited, to accommodate around 100,000 refugees, an effort to ease congestion in the squalid camps. But the relocation plan has been controversial from the start. The island has only existed since around 2003, formed by a buildup of loose silt. Human-rights groups warn it may be vulnerable to extreme weather in an area that is cyclone-prone. It is also hard to reach, located about three hours by boat from the nearest mainland town, and could be difficult for humanitarian workers to access. The United Nations refugee agency has distanced itself from the project. The body said on Wednesday, ahead of Friday’s shift, that the U.N. “has not been involved in preparations for this movement or the identification of refugees and has limited information on the overall relocation exercise.”\n",

      " The acting Nelson Mandela Bay metro mayor says residents must work with law enforcement authorities so that they are not policed. The mayor says the tightening of regulations, especially the curfew, is necessary because taverns are becoming a problem. He has welcomed the tightening of lockdown restrictions, saying they will help flatten the Covid-19 surge in the metro by Christmas. Acting Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Tshonono Buyeye believes President Cyril Ramaphosa's decision to tighten some lockdown restrictions in the region will help flatten the Covid-19 curve and lead to more relaxed conditions come Christmas. Buyeye was addressing the media outside the City Hall in Port Elizabeth on Friday, following Ramaphosa's announcement on the restrictions on Thursday night. The president declared Nelson Mandela Bay a coronavirus hotspot and said the decision to do so was made after a recommendation from the National Coronavirus Command Council in consultation with premiers, metro mayors and traditional leaders. While Alert Level 1 restrictions are in place countrywide, additional restrictions were implemented in the metro from midnight. The restrictions include a 22:00 to 04:00 curfew, and the reduction of trading hours for alcohol outlets from 10:00 to 18:00 from Mondays to Thursdays.\n",

Chahal turned out to be the perfect concussion substitute after an injured Jadeja did his part with the bat in India's impressive 11-run victory. While Jadeja smashed an unbeaten 44 off 23 balls to propel India to 161 for 7, his head injury allowed India to unleash Chahal (3/25 in 4 overs) on an Australian side caught completely off-guard. \"There were no plans of having Yuzi (Chahal) in the game. Jaddu (Jadeja) got a knock on the side of the head and was a bit dizzy and still is,\" Kohli said in the post-match presentation. \"Concussion replacements are a strange thing, today it worked for us maybe another time he wouldn't have found a like-for-like,\" he added. Kohli was full of praise for all his players but singled out Jadeja and Chahal for their efforts. \"He (Chahal) came in and bowled really well. The pitch offered him enough.

Video/Illustration: Jaden Urbi and Zoë Soriano Eric Sylvers Before the coronavirus swept through New York, Lawrence Rosenberg took the subway to his office in Midtown and often crossed Central Park on a bus to drop off his son at preschool. “If it was too long to go by foot, I always got the subway,” said Mr. Rosenberg, an asset manager. He and his wife haven’t been on public transportation since March. He either walks with his son across the park or takes a scooter, and he hasn’t worked from his office since the pandemic started. Before getting back on the subway or a bus, Mr. Rosenberg is waiting for a broader solution to the pandemic, such as a widely deployed vaccine or a more effective testing regime. The decision by would-be passengers like Mr. Rosenberg to avoid public transportation is one of the conundrums large cities are trying to solve.

      " Man who raped his 9-year-old granddaughter and showed her porn handed life sentence A 73-year-old man from Ninapark was sentenced to two life terms and 20 years' imprisonment by the Pretoria North Regional Court for raping, sexually assaulting and exposing his 9-year-old granddaughter to pornography. This was after he was convicted of two counts of rape, four counts of sexual assault and one count of exposure to pornography, said National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Lumka Mahanjana. These incidents occurred between 2014 and 2016 when the girl and her brother were left in the care of their grandfather while their mother and grandmother were at work. The girl confided in her father's friend about her ordeal after he noticed that something was wrong with the child. The friend told the child's father, who then reported the matter to the police. After an investigation, the grandfather was summoned to appear in court in 2017. The man's name cannot be revealed to protect the identity of the girl, who is a minor. The NPA welcomed the sentence.\n",

      " Pandemic deepens digital divide in largely cashless, smartphone-driven society, prompting Beijing to order public services to make exceptions for elderly Eva Xiao China is rolling out new measures to help seniors, as the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbates the digital divide for its rapidly aging population. The State Council, China’s cabinet, released a document last week calling on businesses and local authorities to take steps to assist seniors, including accepting cash and allowing paper alternatives to the digital health codes that have been required to access most public places—from hospitals to shopping centers to office buildings—during the pandemic. China, which has leapfrogged other countries in the use of digital payments, was already tricky terrain for those uncomfortable with technology. But the pandemic has amplified the problem. Recent incidents have sparked outrage on Chinese social media over poor treatment of the elderly. In August, state broadcaster CCTV and other Chinese media reported that an elderly man had been forced off a bus during rush hour in Harbin, in northern Heilongjiang province, because he didn’t scan his health code. Last week, Chinese media reported that an elderly person in Yichang, in central Hubei province, had weathered the rain to pay for medical insurance but was rejected because cash wasn’t allowed.\n",

      " SIMPAC Revolutionizes Press Manufacturing with its New CX Series & IIOT Technology TROY, Mich., Dec. 4, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- SIMPAC America, North American subsidiary of South Korea's SIMPAC Inc., announces the recent launch of parent company SIMPAC's new gap-frame CX Series and its IIOT technology designed to accelerate small part production of stamped parts for the appliance, automotive, and other general industries. When developing the CX Series, SIMPAC heavily focused on multiple convenience and user-friendly components, including the application of the new electric system, SPMS (SIMPAC Press Monitoring System). The SPMS is a user-centered interface created to incorporate IIOT into future SIMPAC press models. Its advanced safety and expandability features greatly surpass the press manufacturer's previous Operator Panel (OP Panel), manufactured back in 2010. The SPMS system is now freely movable with its integrated pendant and arm attachments, allowing for greater accessibility. \"The all-new CX Series was designed to be an industry-leading gap-frame press for the production of various general stamping applications. This model is equipped with automation-friendly features such as multiple cams and newly designed SPMS press controls – creating a new standard for operations and digitization,\" explains Mr. KH Song, Head of Overseas Dept. at SIMPAC, Inc. \"We are confident that the CX Series will exceed metal former's expectations with its effective and versatile performance.\" Additional technological advancements of the CX Series include FEM analysis to increase durability and frame strength of the press, progressive feeder sensors for monitoring quantitative measurements of refuels, injections, and adjustments in lubrication, and new temperature sensors on the drive units to ensure preservation of the press and longevity of equipment lifespan. Stampers interested in the CX Series will experience the wide supporting 4 and 6-sided gibs for tackling eccentric loads, greater accuracy, and high precision. The CX's wet type clutch and brake assembly with its built-in flywheel will enable high energy at high speeds – with a low noise level due to the improved gear drive system. The CX's applied O-Ring and Gib Oil Cutter along with improvements made to the crank, drive parts, and balance structure will drastically reduce any potential oil leakage. \"Look, our customers are always our first priority. We hear all the time from plant managers all over North America that, even for the production of small parts, size really does matter when it comes to maximum flexibility on the shop floor,\" states Stephan Robertson, General Manager/VP of Sales & Operations at SIMPAC America. \"This is why the CX is already showing high demand. It provides a bigger bolster, longer slide stroke, and wider shut height range – essentially covering the immediate needs stressed by multiple industries, including the EV market.\"\n",

Joe Wallace LONDON—Ivan Glasenberg, the longtime chief executive of Glencore PLC, is handing over the reins of the global mining and trading giant he built, saying Friday he would retire in the first half of next year. The Switzerland-based, London-listed company said it had tapped Gary Nagle, a senior deputy who currently runs the company’s coal industrial assets, as his successor. Mr. Glasenberg, a 63-year-old South African, joined Glencore in 1984 and has been CEO since 2002. He orchestrated the company’s stock-market flotation in 2011 and shortly after merged it with miner Xstrata, transforming it from a privately held commodities trading business into a publicly listed mining and trading giant. Two years ago, he started to lay out a timeline for when he might stand down, and more recently said it was getting close to time for him and his senior leadership team to step aside for the next generation of managers.\n",

Adult social care services in the city, which support the elderly, disabled, people with mental health conditions and many more, will see their funding slashed by £13.2 million in the next two years. Children’s services face £6.4 million cuts, parking and bin collection charges are among a series of local authority fees that will be increased, and 15 jobs will be lost. The council is proposing a council tax rise of 4.95%, including a 3% precept for adult social care, according to draft proposals published on Friday. That rise, which is just short of the maximum 5% permitted by the Government next year without councils needing to hold a referendum on it, will equate to annual increases of between £56 and £169 depending on your home’s council tax band. Some adults who receive care services from the council could also face new charges of £5 per week to pay for their support to be arranged from April 2021.\n",

Lara Madison, who lives nearby, saw parents and students gathering around the school's sign to take group pictures marking the moment. None of them were wearing masks. And Madison's brain synapses began firing. \"The first thought in my head as I was driving by them was, 'I wonder how many of these will be on my caseload in a week,' \" the 47-year-old said. Every time Madison leaves the house it is like this. She can not look at someone without calculating risk because it's what she does six days a week as a coronavirus contact tracer for the Albany County Health Department. There are up to 30 people a day currently doing contact tracing for Albany County – reaching out to people who have positive COVID-19 tests and trying to ascertain from phone interviews where they contracted the disease and who else they might have infected. Madison, who began by doing in-person outreach to patients in the first months of the pandemic, is now training to manage a team of tracers. But she is still do tracing work once a week, volunteering to work on Sundays to help take the increasing caseload off her colleagues.\n",

The only weather game in town will be the first coastal storm of the season, which looks to bring some shovel-worthy snow to parts of our area. It'll be in and out for the most part on Saturday with a winter-like couple a days to follow. FridayClouds will continue to thicken up through this morning. It's a chilly start to the day with a few flakes flying in the Adirondacks and temperatures in the 20s and low 30s. As we get into the afternoon, most of us will stay dry with the exceptions being the Adirondacks (few snow showers and a little light snow) and down into the mid Hudson Valley (a few rain light rain showers). It'll otherwise be breezy with highs ranging from the low 30s to the mid 40s, respectively. Areas in between will hold in the upper 30s and low 40s. Getting into the nighttime hours, a storm will be organizing itself to impact at least parts of our area as we get into the weekend. As is almost always the case, details still remain to be sorted out but I'm a bit more confident as to the forecast. Rain will develop overnight to the east and southeast of Albany. Temperatures will range from the low to the upper 30s across the area.\n",

      " Podcast: New research shows Alexander Hamilton owned enslaved people Jessie Serfilippi, who has an MFA in creative writing and primarily writes fiction, stands beneath a portrait of Hamilton in the blue room, where Hamilton married Schuyler’s daughter, Elizabeth, on Dec. 14, 1780. Jessie Serfilippi, a 27-year-old novice historian, caused a stir and received national media attention after publishing an article on the Schuyler Mansion’s website recently that debunked the myth of Founding Father Alexander Hamilton as an abolitionist and documented his role as a trader and owner of enslaved people. America's first treasury secretary-turned-Broadway musical star Alexander Hamilton was back in the spotlight recently, but not for a flattering reason. New historical research from the Schuyler State Historic Site provides compelling evidence that this \"Ten-dollar founding father without a father,\" whom historian Ron Chernow called an \"uncompromising abolitionist,\" was in fact, a slave-owner. Also on this episode, reporter Wendy Liberatore discusses a 27-year-old cold case murder from Saratoga county, and Shopportunist Shannon Fromma shares a few tips and tricks for taking care of that holiday gift list.

Cash holdings at nonfinancial companies grew to a record $2.1 trillion at the end of June, according to a recent report from Moody’s Investors Service. That is up 30% from that time last year and higher than the previous peak of nearly $2 trillion in 2017. Among the biggest hoarders: AT&T Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc., which each held more than $15 billion at the end of June. Other measures show some of America’s largest companies continued to hang on to record cash stockpiles at the end of the third quarter. The amount held by S&P 500 companies not in the financial, transportation or utilities sectors is expected to total around $1.9 trillion, according to data compiled by S&P Dow Jones Indices. That is the most cash ever held by that group in data going back to 1980. Cash hoards swelled this year after companies issued record-breaking amounts of debt to bolster their balance sheets against the Covid-19 pandemic’s disruptions. As of Nov. 30, companies had sold more than $2 trillion of investment-grade and high-yield bonds—the most on record in data going back to 2006—according to LCD, a unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. At the same time, many cut share repurchases, dividends or capital expenditures. Now that is starting to reverse, raising hopes for moves such as buybacks, which can drive share prices higher, and paying down debt, which reduces risk for bondholders.\n",

Denis Carey of Garden Field, Dromcollogher, Limerick, pleaded guilty to inviting a child to engage in a sexual act at a public toilet that would have involved the commission of an offence against the child. Garda Yvonne Cashman told Cork Circuit Criminal Court that at 4.06pm on 30 April, 2019 a fifteen year old boy in north Cork went to use a public toilet in his town. He had just finished school for the day. Carey asked the boy to participate in oral sex and made sexual gestures. The boy ran out of the toilets and went home. However, 30 minutes later the boy told his father what had occurred. The father and son returned in their car to the public toilets to find that Carey was still parked in the area. When he saw the boy he moved his car and started to drive away. The father and son followed him for a period. Carey made a voluntary statement at a north Cork garda station where he denied any wrongdoing. However, he said he thought the boy was in the public toilet for sex.\n",

It's the 63-year-old's first coaching job since being axed by Zimbabwe last year. De Villiers coached the Springboks to success over the British and Irish Lions in 2009. Former Springbok coach Peter de Villiers has been appointed the new EP Elephants head coach, after fighting off stiff competition for the post, the Eastern Province Rugby Union (EPRU) confirmed on Friday. It is De Villiers' first head coaching job in the senior provincial ranks in South Africa since being let go by SA Rugby when his four-year Bok term expired in 2011, following the Rugby World Cup quarter-final exit to the Wallabies. Although he coached the University of Western Cape between 2013 and 2015, \"Div\" has found it tough getting coaching gigs domestically - sometimes accusing his former employers at Plattekloof of \"blacklisting\" him.\n",

(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File)Bebeto Matthews ALBANY — A former Verizon worker who was caught exercising and lifting weights after claiming she had suffered debilitating arm injuries was arrested Thursday in East Syracuse on charges of grand larceny, falsifying business records and other felonies. Kelly M. Gersbacher, 44, had sustained carpal tunnel-related injuries to both arms in August 2016 while working as a technician for Verizon. The state inspector general's office, which announced her arrest, said Gersbacher had sustained carpal tunnel-related injuries to both arms in August 2016, and underwent multiple surgeries between 2017 and 2019. She began receiving workers’ compensation indemnity payments nearly two years ago and also was compenstated with payments through Verizon’s disability benefits plan. During medical examinations last year, Gersbacher claimed she could only lift 10 pounds and that her injuries prevented her from going to the gym. Doctors determined she was \"moderately disabled\" and she received $19,000 in workers' compensation benefits. The inspector general's office said that video surveillance during a two-month period last year showed Gersbacher running errands and working out at gyms, including performing deadlifts \"far exceeding 10 pounds\"\n",

      " Some doctors reported working 90 hours a week. ACTION IS NEEDED to curb workplace bullying and excessive working hours for doctors, some of whom work 90 hours a week, a new report from the Medical Council has warned. The report from the regulatory body for doctors said that more than 1,100 doctors left the profession last year, with many of them citing reasons including lack of support, excessive hours and resourcing issues. “It is completely unreasonable to expect Doctors to work over 90 hours in a week and then provide no time to recover,” one disgruntled doctor told the council. Doctor’s are not robots.

      " Assets in these pre-baked investment kits recently surpassed $4 trillion to reach a new high Dawn Lim Assets in model portfolios hit a record high this fall, reflecting growing interest in preset investment options developed by Wall Street firms. Data provider Broadridge Financial Solutions estimates that model portfolios held $4.1 trillion of assets in September, up from $3.5 trillion at the end of 2019. Model portfolios are ready-made fund combos delivered through financial advisers and brokerages to everyday investors. There is no ready definition of a model portfolio. But the typical adviser using model portfolios is doing the equivalent of serving a store-bought pie, rather than baking one special from scratch. The portfolios come in all shapes and sizes and are today surging in popularity as advisers seek quick ways to invest client money. A portfolio might use a classic investment formula of 60% in equity strategies and 40% in bond funds split between a dozen funds, for instance, or use algorithms to dynamically shift the funds it invests in as markets change.\n",

Head coach Ivan van Rooyen has invested in a few talks this week to make sure the on-field decision-makers are on the same page. Skipper Elton Jantjies hopes the composure they showed in the win over Griquas is on show again. Three or seven points? One of rugby's most common on-field decisions has now been given added significance since last weekend's Currie Cup meeting between Griquas and the Lions was suspended after 48 minutes due to lightning. It's the second fixture since local rugby's resumption - the Bulls walked away with a comprehensive 39-6 victory over the Stormers in Super Rugby Unlocked after 62 minutes - to have ended prematurely because of foul weather and emphasises the risk of playing the game during the summer months.\n",

      " Black Bear is two dramas in one, and Aubrey Plaza is great in both of them Note: The writer of this review watched Black Bear on a digital screenerfrom home. Before making the decision to see it—or any other film—in a movie theater, please consider the health risks involved. Here’san interview on the matter with scientific experts. Advertisement Black Bear is the movie that proves, beyond any lingering doubt, that Aubrey Plaza has much more to offer than the best eye-roll in the business. Maybe that was clear already. Plaza, after all, has had a pretty good few years, expanding her range with volatile, animated performances in Ingrid Goes Went and the FX superhero spinoff Legion. (She’s had a pretty good couple weeks, too—just ask everyone convinced that it was her character Riley that should have ended up with Kristen Stewart’s Abby at the end of The Happiest Season.) Yet Black Bear, a claustrophobic mind-game psychodrama that premiered at Sundance back in January and is now sliding into commercial release, feels like the richest showcase yet for Plaza’s talents… or at least for the ones that went unexploited during the years when the former sitcom star was doing variations, via typecasting or reflex, on the comic shtick she mastered and deepened on Parks And Recreation. Advertisement In general disposition, the main character of Black Bear isn’t so radically different than April Ludegate. Plaza plays Allison, a one-time indie starlet who moved into filmmaking after she stopped getting acting gigs. (“Unsuccessful, small ones that nobody likes,” is how she describes her movies.) Allison has decamped for a secluded lakeside cabin in Upstate New York, where she hopes to push through a recent bout of writer’s block. From the moment we meet her, we can detect traces of what you could call vintage Plaza: deadpan, withering, aloof, doing an exquisitely refined millennial upgrade of Gen X ironic remove. Black Bear recognizes those qualities as a front, a carefully crafted persona, and it isn’t long before we learn that every third word that comes out of Allison’s mouth is a lie. Right from the start, the film is operating as a commentary on the usual Plaza type; the role was written for her, and it shows. Black Bear\n",

Oh lord, I’m on my knees, wishing and praying. And, if I do that hard enough, I hope when I open my eyes at 5:30am PST on December 8, there’ll be a marvellous little package waiting for me. A Christmas miracle, if you will. That, friends, is what I’d call a longwinded and uninformative way of saying there might be some new Apple hardware announced next week. This was revealed by the lovely folks over at MacRumors, who obtained an internal Apple memo advising AppleCare technicians to prepare for new products. Of course, this might turn out to be nothing, but there are a few clues that suggest new Apple hardware may be tumbling into our living rooms next week. First off, memos like this have been leaked in the past, and, generally, they precede an actual announcement.

      " Sam Gary, who has died at age 94, hit a gusher in Montana and devoted a large share of his profits to helping children Sam Gary in the mid-1970s. James R. Hagerty Growing up in Manhattan, the son of a lingerie maker, Sam Gary refashioned himself as an urban Tom Sawyer. He and his pals rambled through the wilder parts of Central Park and slipped out of the city by train whenever possible to ski, hunt or fish. Mr. Gary, who died Nov. 16 at the age of 94, studied at Syracuse University but was unhappy with formal education and convinced he was no good at it. He saw just one option: Go West. After marrying Nancy Howard in 1953, he set off with her in a station wagon, with a cocker spaniel and a silver tea service (never to be used) on board. She was pregnant with their first child. The idea was to reconnoiter Denver and other Western cities and decide which one they liked best. Denver suited them so well that they canceled the rest of the trip. Mr. Gary found work in the oil industry, initially as a scout, gathering information for independent oil drillers, and later as a landsman, negotiating drilling rights. His gift for schmoozing helped him strike deals, and the job was perfect for a man who loved roaming in wide-open spaces. In 1958, he formed his own oil-exploration company. After years of dry holes, he hit a gusher on June 29, 1967, in southeastern Montana. His Bell Creek discovery contained an estimated 240 million barrels of oil and was ranked as the 84th largest oil field in the U.S.\n",

      " “What would you do if you were stuck in one place, and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?” —Phil Connors, Groundhog Day Advertisement When Palm Springsstarted streaming on Hulu in July, it felt like the movie of the moment. The film’s stuck-in-the-same-day premise provided an eerily prescient metaphor for the hazy, repetitive blur of our pandemic summer. Now, five months later, it’s clear that Palm Springs wasn’t just the defining movie of the summer but one of the defining movies of the year. Much like a time loop that proves harder to escape than a character first assumes, the COVID-19 pandemic has lasted far longer than most of us ever could’ve imagined in the early days of lockdown. In other words, there’s new resonance, in 2020, to watching two unhappy people navigate the existential dread of weeks and months blending into one meaningless expanse of time. One reason Palm Springs became such a hit is because it combines the two main forms of entertainment that people have turned to during quarantine: light, fluffy escapism like Notting Hillor Something’s Gotta Give, and darkly relevant stories like Contagionor Alien. Palm Springs offers the joy of watching Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti fall in love over the course of several fun-as-hell montages that turn the time-loop zaniness up to 11. But it also delivers some relevant existential musing about the human condition: If you had to be trapped in purgatory, would it be better to be there by yourself or with an unwitting stranger as company? Which is scarier, loneliness or commitment? Of course, Palm Springs’ success isn’t solely due to COVID. It was a buzzy hit when it debuted at Sundance in January, back when the idea of living through a global pandemic seemed impossible. The Lonely Island-produced film broke the record for the highest sale in the festival’s history, thanks to a cheeky 69 cents added to its $17.5 million price tag. Enthusiastic Sundance reviews found plenty of meaning in the film as a metaphor for millennial ennui and marriage. (Sundance audiences went in unspoiled on the film’s time-loop premise, something the trailer later gave away.) Butthere’s no doubt that Palm Springs has taken on new significance thanks to the state of the world in which it was released—as have other other time-loop stories like Happy Death Day, Before I Fall,Edge Of Tomorrow, and, of course, the godfather of the genre, Groundhog Day. Advertisement Interestingly, Palm Springs didn’t actually start as a time-loop movie. Screenwriter Andy Siara and director Max Barbakow first imagined the script as an absurdist comedic mumblecore take on Leaving Las Vegas,centered on a despondent thirtysomething who travels to Palm Springs to kill himself, only to slowly rediscover a sense of meaning in his life. Siara and Barbakow came up with the idea as students at the American Film Institute, with an equal eye on Jungian philosophical ideas and the pragmatic importance of writing a small-budget film that would be easy to produce. After working as a writer on AMC’s innovative series Lodge 49,however,Siara decided to take a bigger sci-fi swing. Once Samberg and the Lonely Island team came onboard, they helped creatively shepherd the script toward the finish line.\n",

Data gathered have produced images five times more sensitive and twice as detailed as previous ones. What is radio astronomy? Modern astronomy is a multi-wavelength enterprise. What do we mean by this? Well, most objects in the universe (including humans) emit radiation over a broad spectrum, called the electromagnetic spectrum. This includes both visible and invisible light such as X-rays, ultraviolet light, infrared light, and radio waves. To understand the universe, we need to observe the entire electromagnetic spectrum as each wavelength carries different information. Radio waves have the longest wavelength of all forms of light. They allow us to study some of the most extreme environments in the universe, from cold clouds of gas to supermassive black holes. Long wavelengths pass through clouds, dust, and the atmosphere with ease, but need to be received with large antennas. Australia’s wide open (but relatively low-altitude) spaces are the perfect place to build large radio telescopes.\n",

      " Suga, who took office in mid-September, set climate change as one of his main policy goals along with promoting a digital transformation of Japanese society — issues which were left behind by his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, who resigned because of ill health. “The fund is to bolster environmental investment as we aim to become a global leader in this area,” Suga said. He pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 in a policy speech in October, though it will be a major challenge given Japan’s significant reliance on fossil fuel. Suga, in his first full-fledged news conference since taking office, said Friday that his Cabinet plans next week to approve an economic package that will also include 1 trillion yen ($9.5 billion) to promote the country's digital transformation — a weakness that Japan recognized when companies were requested to allow employees to work from home in response to the coronavirus and many were unable to. Although he is known for a pragmatic approach to getting things done, it's unclear whether Suga has the political heft to overcome vested interests in weaning the resource-poor nation from its reliance on imported oil and gas. He said Japan needs to strive to become a global leader in achieving carbon neutrality, and that investment in the environment is a growth opportunity, not a burden. Suga repeated that he plans to deepen Japan's alliance with the United States and promote a vision of a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” to counter growing Chinese influence in the region.\n",

Here’s how the country is revamping its propaganda machine to target new audiences who speak English, French and Chinese. Photo composite: Sharon Shi By Andrew Jeong North Korean propaganda has long struck a familiar chord, spewing vitriol toward imperialist outsiders and fawning over the ruling Kim family’s achievements. But Pyongyang’s image makers are now peddling a softer image of the Kim regime, which is best known for being nuclear-armed, reclusive and impoverished. The makeover attempts surfaced last month, when, in an unusual tactic, separate Twitter accounts appeared bearing the names of two Pyongyang bureaucrats: Kim Myong Il, a negotiator who appeared at 2018 inter-Korean talks, and Han Song Il, of a Pyongyang institute considered to be a propaganda agency. The posts—in English, Japanese, Chinese and Korean—depicted everyday life.\n",

      " TNW Sites COVID-19 antibodies may fade faster in men than women In the global effort to overcome COVID-19, much scientific and medical attention has focused on the ability of our immune system to generate antibodies. Antibodies are one of our body’s main weapons against viruses, created to recognize specific proteins on a virus’s surface and initiate processes that ultimately neutralize and remove the virus. We know that for other human coronaviruses, when the body creates antibodies against them, these then go on to provide immunity. Teams developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are confident, therefore, that their vaccines can produce similarly effective responses against COVID-19. But there is still much to understand – not least how long these vaccines will protect us for. Luckily, science is gradually catching up with the virus, and we are starting to understand more about antibody responses to it. One unexpected finding was recently uncovered by a French study. The research (which is yet to be peer-reviewed) examined SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the blood of hospital staff who had tested positive for the virus and were displaying mild symptoms. By analyzing two samples from each person taken a few months apart, the investigators were able to determine how quickly antibody levels fade after infection, and which factors were associated with this decline. Antibodies are created to recognize specific parts of an invading substance. They are usually highly specialized. Kateryna Kon/Shutterstock The study found that antibodies that recognized the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, one of the key proteins on the virus’s surface, decreased more quickly in men than women. As these levels fell, so too did the body’s ability to neutralize the virus. Although the study also looked at the effect of age and body mass index (BMI), neither of these variables were associated with more rapid antibody decline or were linked to the effect in men.\n",

My editor ordered me to try making as much money as possible as fast as possible, to become part of the momentum-investing crowd. That called for a makeover. I’d have to become the polar opposite of the patient, research-intensive, risk-averse investor I’ve always been.\n",

      " TNW Sites Neutrinos from our Sun hold the secrets to nuclear fusion Most people realize our Sun is producing light and heat from the fusion of hydrogen into helium. However, the process of merging together hydrogen nuclei into helium is not as straightforward as it might seem. Typically, there are two processes by which smaller stars create fusion. The first of these, the proton-proton (pp) reaction is the simpler, as well as the more common, of the two. The second, the Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen (CNO) cycle, is thought to be the predominant means of producing energy in hotter, more massive stars. However, a new study finds neutrinos from theSunproviding the first direct evidence of the CNO cycle taking place deep within our parent star. “Although on the basis of model calculations we expected the CNO cycle also to occur in the Sun, direct evidence of this has never been obtained before. Only a characteristic neutrino signal can provide conclusive proof that this actually happens — now we have that conclusive proof without a shadow of a doubt,”Michael Wurm, a neutrino physicist at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU) and member of the Borexino Collaboration, describes. For every reaction, there’s a harder-to-remember reaction\n",

(AP) — By late morning on Oct. 28, staff at the University of Vermont Medical Center noticed the hospital’s phone system wasn’t working. Then the internet went down, and the Burlington-based center's technical infrastructure with it. Employees lost access to databases, digital health records, scheduling systems and other online tools they rely on for patient care. In its main laboratory, which runs about 8,000 tests a day, employees printed or hand-wrote results and carried them across facilities to specialists. Outdated, internet-free technologies experienced a revival. “We went around and got every fax machine that we could,” said UVM Medical Center Chief Operating Officer Al Gobeille.

After all, Dubravka had been Newcastle's most consistent performer across each of the last two campaigns, while number two goalkeeper Karl Darlow had not kept net in a Premier League match for over two-and-a-half years. Freddie Woodman, the club's talented former under-20 World Cup winner, had just penned a new three-year deal at the club and headed off to Swansea on loan knowing that Newcastle saw him as the club's long term successor to Dubravka. In the eyes of most fans, Darlow, who had impressed at both Championship and Premier League level when called upon in fairness to him, was very much a back-up goalkeeper - despite his new five-year deal at the club. So when it was confirmed Dubravka would be facing months out, there was apprehension among the Toon Army knowing that Darlow would be thrust into the number one position.\n",

      "Saira Khan Dec. 4, 2020 8:42 am ET Actor Christian Serratos, 30, can really sing. Known for playing Rosita Espinosa in The Walking Dead, Serratos can soon be heard exercising her vocal chords as the late Mexican-American singer Selena Quintanilla in Netflix’s Selena: The Series, the first season of which is out December 4. She is quick to note, however, that she didn’t sing all of the songs on the show. “If there’s singing in an acting scene or if you see us on the bus, that’s me,” she says. “But the performances are all [Selena], which is how it should be. As a diehard Selena fan, I want to hear Selena.” The Netflix series follows the early life of Quintanalla, known as the “Queen of Tejano” music, whose singing career was cut short when she was murdered at the age of 23 by the founder of her fan club, Yolanda Saldívar. It’s the first on-screen depiction of Quintanalla’s life since a young Jennifer Lopez played her in the 1997 film Selena, which made over $11.6 million on its opening weekend and earned Lopez her first Golden Globe award nomination. While the ‘90s movie primarily focused on the last few years of Quintanilla’s life, the new show captures the singer’s childhood. Showing Quintanalla’s innocent side was important to Serratos. “She was very silly,” she says. “I think that’s what made her so beautiful.” WSJ. caught up with Serratos over Zoom about her unconventional audition, what she found challenging about the role and her favorite Selena songs.\n",

      " Siobhan Hughes WASHINGTON—President-elect Joe Biden’s cabinet picks will face a narrow path in the Senate next year, with the confirmation process providing an early test of the new administration’s ability to work with Republicans amid heightened partisan rancor over nominees. Republicans are set to hold at least 50 seats, compared with 48 for Democrats, with two seats from Georgia up for grabs in runoff elections scheduled for Jan. 5. In a 50-50 Senate, Democrats would hold the majority, as incoming Vice President Kamala Harris would break any ties. If Democrats fall short, Republicans would be in charge, the first time in decades that a new president has a Senate controlled by the opposite party. Mr. Biden has announced picks for his national security and economic teams, two areas where the Senate tends to move most quickly on confirmations, typically starting with hearings in the new year and holding votes as soon as Jan. 20. So far, some individual nominees have drawn opposition, but many Republican senators have signaled they plan to broadly show deference to Mr. Biden as he assembles his team, rather than actively obstruct his efforts. “There are some that are clearly coming with baggage that may make it very difficult for the Senate to approve them,” said Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.) of the nominees. “I give the president the benefit of the doubt if it’s a close call. If it’s not a close call, you let the chips fall.” “The president should be able to have his team,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.), who expects to sit down with nominees before committee hearings. “But I don’t think that’s a blanket statement that you rubber-stamp folks.”\n",

Ivan Toney, the Peterborough forward scoring freely in League One, ticked so many boxes. The scouting reports noted his strength, his finishing and - most importantly - leadership qualities. The Championship promotion hopefuls were 90 minutes from the top flight in 2019/20 and felt the team had been \"a bit too nice\". Toney, who - scouts noted - 'managed' referees in games and had the edge they were missing, might just change that. Fourteen goals into the season, it looks like the right call. But his emergence as the top English goalscorer underneath the Premier League, at the same time as Blackburn's Adam Armstrong, poses questions about Newcastle's youth development.\n",

      " Stevie Nicks performed at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Brooklyn, N.Y., in March 2019. Anne Steele Stevie Nicks closed a deal to sell a majority stake in her publishing catalog late last month, on the heels of Fleetwood Mac’s “Dreams” hitting the Billboard charts for the first time since 1977. Music publisher Primary Wave purchased an 80% interest in the copyrights, which are valued at about $100 million, according to people familiar with the deal. The deal, which includes hits “Edge of Seventeen,” “Rhiannon” and “Landslide,” highlights the soaring value of music in the streaming era. Ms. Nicks’ sale coincides with recent buzz around “Dreams” fueled by a viral TikTok video of a man skateboarding while listening to the Fleetwood Mac former No. 1 single. The song, written by Ms. Nicks, landed at No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 in October, logging its best-ever week of streams and download sales in the U.S. Ms. Nicks and Primary Wave plan to partner on marketing, branding and digital strategies to generate more revenue from her catalog, according to the publisher. Outlets for music are rising in new corners of the digital world, from videogaming to social media to advertising. Over the past five years, owning the rights to music has become more valuable as revenue from music streaming has grown.

      " Boston Consulting Group announced its plans Wednesday, saying it would expand a business service center in Atlanta that it created in 2017, which now employs 268. Boston Consulting Group is based in the Massachusetts city of the same name. The privately held company had $8.5 billion in revenue last year. Besides the business service center, Boston Consulting Group also owns BrightHouse, a creative consultancy and branding agency based in Atlanta. Across three offices, Boston Consulting Group employs more than 900 in metro Atlanta. The company will increase its office space for its business service center by 60,000 square feet (5,500 square meters). Local officials welcomed the investment in downtown Atlanta, which has long faced competition from other office centers in the metro area. The company will qualify for a state income tax credit that allows the company to deduct $3,500 per job from its Georgia income taxes for five years. If Boston Consulting Group doesn’t incur $5.8 million in state income taxes, it can also use the credit to get cash payments redirected to it out of the money it withholds from employee paychecks for state income taxes, given its location in what the state classifies as a state opportunity zone. Other incentives haven't been finalized yet, said Marie Hodge Gordon, spokesperson for the Georgia Economic Development Department.\n",

      " BORIS JOHNSON has been accused of selling out the UK in the Brexit talks, according to an enraged Brexiteer. Brexit in name only is 'best we can hope for' says expert Former Brexit Party MEP Alexandra Phillips has claimed she is terrified of the Brexit deal Boris Johnson will bring back to the UK. While speaking to Mike Graham on TalkRadio she said Boris Johnson had already tied the UK into a bad deal with the EU with the withdrawal agreement. She added that the best Brexiteers can hope for is a \"Brexit In Name Only\" (BRINO) as the end of the transition period was less than a month away. Trending Ms Phillips said: \"We are left with such limited time we are talking a matter of weeks before the end of the transition period. \"There are going to be about 1,500 pages of really intense legal jargon that politicians should utterly scrutinise before giving a cent to this. \"We saw what happened last time that Boris Johnson rushed through the withdrawal agreement, he annexed a constituent country of the UK to a foreign power to the extent that we can't even send food from one part of the UK to the other.\"\n",

      " EU extends ban on Pakistan's airline from flying to Europe ISLAMABAD (AP) — The European Union’s aviation safety agency has extended a ban imposed on Pakistan's state-run airline this year barring it from flying to Europe after a plane crash that killed 97 people in the port city of Karachi, a spokesman said Friday. At the time — and while the probe into the May 22 Airbus A320 crash was still underway — authorities acknowledged that nearly a third of Pakistani pilots, 260 out of 860, had cheated on their pilot’s exams. Pakistan International Airlines subsequently grounded 150 of its pilots while a probe by the country’s Civil Aviation Authority into the other pilots is still ongoing. In first imposing the ban, the EU agency said it was “concerned about the validity of the Pakistani pilot licenses.\" It added that Pakistan was not capable of certifying and overseeing “its operators and aircraft in accordance with applicable international standards.\" Abdullah Hafeez, a spokesman for Pakistan International Airlines told The Associated Press on Friday that the EU's Aviation Safety Agency informed them about its decision to extend the ban after analyzing a report about additional steps taken by PIA to enhance safety measures. No timeframe was given for the duration of the ban's extension. According to Hafeez, although the agency praised PIA for taking additional safety steps, it opted to have the ban remain in effect until Pakistan resolves an issue related to issuing pilot licenses. He did not elaborate.\n",

The trade deficit widened to $63.1 billion from $62.1 billion. The figures were adjusted for seasonal variations.

Imports from China rose to $44.83 billion from $41.21 billion, hitting the highest level since December 2018. Global trade has recovered more quickly than economists expected since widespread lockdowns were imposed in March and April, but activity remains well below pre-pandemic levels. Economists say the outlook for trade remains uncertain amid the acceleration in the spread of the virus globally, but particularly in the U.S. “Virus transmissions remain elevated and widening restrictions on activity, at home and abroad, have the potential to disrupt supply chains and weigh on demand,” Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics said in a research note.\n",

(AP) — A former Oregon State University employee has filed a lawsuit saying he was fired because he took parental leave. Joseph McQuillin was assistant director of facilities maintenance and custodial manager in the university’s department of recreational sports when his wife gave birth to premature twins in 2017, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. According to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene Wednesday, his wife and twins required extended medical care so McQuillin filed for protected medical leave followed by sick child leave, which OSU approved. According to the lawsuit, McQuillin communicated about it with his direct supervisor, associate director Bill Callender. In January 2019, McQuillin returned to work. According to the lawsuit, Callender told McQuillin that his medical leave had “left people in the lurch.\" Callender also told McQuillin that Leah Dorothy, the director of recreational sports, was stripping him of his supervisory duties and removing him from the team of directors. The court documents state this appeared to be in retaliation for McQuillin’s taking family leave. The lawsuit also alleges an aspect of gender discrimination, arguing McQuillin was treated differently as a father taking medical leave.\n",

Raquel Terán who was featured in The Arizona Republic after he voted for the first time in his life this year has died of complications from the coronavirus. Rodolfo “Rudy” Barron, 65, was hospitalized with COVID-19 about 10 days after he voted and remained there for five weeks where he died on Sunday, The Republic reported. He had two children and four grandchildren. Barron was featured in an article in October about first-time voters, expressing his pride in his decision to start voting. He said he previously didn't believe his vote mattered much and thought all politicians were crooks and avoided getting involved. But he said this year it was critical to vote. Health officials have reported more than 6,700 Arizona residents have died from COVID-19 as of Wednesday. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some — especially older adults and people with existing health problems — it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. Terán, a Democrat, now counts her family among those most affected after several family members, including herself, contracted the virus. Terán had mild symptoms. Barron’s son Eddie developed pneumonia, from which he has since recovered.\n",

Federal funding has been used to provide more than 2 million tests statewide at no charge since the outset of the pandemic, about 515,000 since Nov. 1, the health department said. There were a reported total of 204,048 virus cases and 1,836 deaths due to COVID-19 since the pandemic began as of Thursday, according to the department. The true number of infections in Oklahoma is likely higher because many haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick.\n",

      " I'm here to start a debate: stocking stuffers are the best thing to open on Christmas. A lot of times, the gifts under the tree are things that you asked for, so there aren't many surprises. But a stocking? The person shopping for you has to know you, whether they know your candy likes, sock preferences, or whether you would rather have gift cards over lottery tickets. Whether this is your first year in charge of filling someone's stocking or your 15th, it's always helpful to get some stocking stuffer gift ideas beyond candy canes and Hershey's kisses. Every stocking stuffer in this gift guide has a purpose, and is small enough to not pull the stocking off the mantle. If their big gift for the year is AirPods, or they already own and love these little Apple headphones, a funky case is needed. Hopefully, you were lucky enough to score AirPods when they were $99 for Black Friday. You can get a bunch of food-themed cases on Amazon, from Fritos to Sour Patch Kids to Ginger Ale to Oreo. I kind of want AirPods just to get the Gatorade case. If you must put candy in a stocking, let it be Ghirardelli. The company is one of the best candy makers in the country, and you can keep the holiday theme by gifting them a couple of peppermint squares. Hot sauce lovers will light up when you get them a bottle of TRUFF sauce. Then, they'll probably tell you about the hottest hot sauce they've ever had and how they couldn't feel their tastebuds for days after. Get weird with TRUFF's white truffle hot sauce, or keep it simple with a two-pack of Hot and Hotter sauce. Continuing with that food theme, you can't go wrong with hot honey. It's naturally sweet, with just the right amount of kick thanks to an infusion of chiles. For anyone who loves pizza and wings (who doesn't), a hot honey topping can be a game-changer. It also pairs well with cheese, and can be added to tea or cocktails. If you have a PB (or Nutella) lover in your life, get them their own dedicated spoon. They can eat right out of the jar to their heart's content. Come to think of it, maybe you should get them their own peanut butter jar as well.\n",

Britain gave the green light Wednesday for emergency use of a vaccine made by German firm BioNTech and U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. The European Medicines Agency has indicated it may not decide whether to grant its authorization until Dec. 29, about two weeks later than Germany had expected to launch a national immunization drive. The former head of Germany's civil protection agency, Albrecht Broemme, was tasked with setting up six mass vaccination sites in Berlin. He said security questions still need to be resolved. Unlike with hospitals, which tend to be treated respectfully, “with the centers it's indeed possible that people opposed to vaccination or others willing to use violence might say ‘Let’s set this on fire because we think vaccinations are stupid,'\" Broemme said. Broemme plans to have “intense conversations” with police and private security firms about the protection of the Berlin vaccination centers, though he added that no concrete threats have been made so far.\n",

Nikos Dendias said Turkey opted not to seize an opportunity that European Union leaders offered it in October to ease tensions in the region so that the 27-member bloc could start reshaping its fraught relations with Ankara. Turkey last week ordered the research vessel Oruc Reis back to port after completing what it said was seismic research in east Mediterranean waters. The warship-escorted vessel’s activities in waters where Greece asserts jurisdiction prompted a military build-up between the two neighbors and nominal NATO allies. Greece countered by also sending its warships, and both countries conducted military exercises to assert their claims. NATO stepped in to prevent a potential armed conflict. But Dendias said the ship’s return to port wasn’t enough.\n",

Princess Diana 'made to feel terrible' by royals claims expert The Princess of Wales’ life behind Palace walls was said to be incredibly difficult. Although she came from an aristocratic family and had relatives who worked closely with the Royal Family themselves, she was not accustomed to being in the limelight as a shy 19-year-old. However, she became an international icon almost overnight after her fairytale wedding won over legions of royal fans. Trending Many praised her for single-handedly modernising the monarchy shortly before she split from Prince Charles — but she was then blamed for jeopardising the institution’s survival after speaking out about her time on the royal frontline. She went on to claim she had been treated very badly by her in-laws, especially when she had postnatal depression. During her bombshell 1995 BBC Panorama interview, she said, “anything good I ever did, nobody ever said a thing” but noted that when she tripped up “a ton of bricks came down on me”.\n",

The bay, which reopened Wednesday, has water that is now 64% clearer than it was before the pandemic, said Lisa Bishop, president of Friends of Hanauma Bay, a conservation group. “(Hanauma Bay) looks exactly as it did 30 to 40 years ago,” said Michele Nekota, the director of the city Department of Parks and Recreation, which operates the bay. A new limit of 720 visitors per day has been implemented because of the pandemic, said Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell. Visitor attendance hovered around roughly 3,000 visitors per day in 2019. ”For the first time in more than 40 years there is no sunscreen in the water, no artificial sedimentation, no people walking on the reefs,” Bishop said. A number of other rules will be enacted as a result of the coronavirus. The bay, which had been closed every Tuesday since 1998, will now also be closed on Mondays.

Daniel Rosemark was sentenced last month to the 361 days he had already served while being held on charges in the case, the Des Moines Register reported. Rosemark pleaded guilty in October to reckless use of fire or explosives as a hate crime and drug possession. A criminal mischief charge was dropped in exchange for his plea. Police said that in November 2019, Rosemark torn down a rainbow pride flag that had been outside The Blazing Saddle in the East Village. Rosemark told officers he did it because he was angry that the gay community had adopted adopted the rainbow as a symbol of pride.

      " Ivory Coast ex-president plans to return home from exile ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — Ivory Coast’s former president Laurent Gbagbo plans to return to his home country after his passport was returned following his acquittal at The Hague last year, his lawyer said Friday. Gbagbo has been unable to return to the West African nation since his January 2019 acquittal under the terms of his release, which had him remain in Belgium after having handed over his passports while awaiting a ruling on an appeal. “Laurent Gbagbo today received two passports, one ordinary and one diplomatic,” lawyer Habiba Toure said. “He welcomes the act just taken by Ivorian authorities which, according to him, goes in the direction of appeasement.” The diplomatic passport can only be issued with the consent of Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara. Gbagbo plans to return to Ivory Coast this month and has appointed Assoa Adou, secretary general of Gbagbo’s political party, to approach authorities so that he can return in peace and in accordance with his status as former president, Toure said. Gbagbo refused to concede defeat after losing the 2010 election to Ouattara. Both men held inauguration ceremonies and the standoff persisted for months until pro-Ouattara forces captured Gbagbo from his underground bunker. More than 3,000 people died during the 2010-2011 crisis. Gbagbo was brought before the International Criminal Court in 2011 to face charges of crimes against humanity, of which he was acquitted.\n",

      " Judge wants remote hearings after guns allowed in courthouse CUSTER, S.D. (AP) — The presiding judge of the 7th Judicial Circuit has written a proposed order saying judges won’t appear in Custer County court after commissioners approved a measure allowing guns inside the courthouse. County commissioners adopted the ordinance to allow firearms despite opposition from presiding Judge Craig Pfeifle and Judge Matt Brown and a state's attorney's opinion that it would be a safety risk, a legal liability and a financial burden. Pfeifle said he’s sent the proposed order to the South Dakota Supreme Court, which will review it for approval or rejection in January, the Rapid City Journal reported. The proposed order says Custer County hearings will be overseen by a judge appearing remotely through audio or video feeds or take place at the Pennington County Courthouse in Rapid City. It’s unclear if lawyers and the public can take advantage of the video and audio feeds if they are concerned for their safety. Custer County won’t have to worry about jury trials for now since COVID-19 has paused the proceedings across the 7th Circuit, which includes Custer, Pennington, Fall River and Oglala Lakota counties.

The SNP leader believes Scots are being “dragged” out of the bloc against their will.

An independent Scotland would now border a non-EU country, likely requiring infrastructure and border checks between regions whose communities are deeply intertwined – similar to the problem of the Irish border that severely complicated Brexit talks. Scotland could also be rejected by Brussels due to its current deficit of seven percent of GDP, unless it adopted a strict austerity programme from the EU as well as potentially adopting the euro.

      " Man linked to white supremacist group to plead guilty COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) — A Maryland man who is scheduled to plead guilty Tuesday in a case stemming from his alleged membership in a white supremacist group wants a federal judge to immediately sentence him at the hearing, a court filing shows. William Bilbrough IV agreed to a specific term of imprisonment as part of his plea deal, a federal prosecutor said in a court filing Thursday. The filing does not specify a charge to which Bilbrough will plead guilty or the length of the prison term he would serve if U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang accepts the plea agreement's terms. FBI agents arrested Bilbrough and two other men in January as part of a broader investigation of a group called The Base. U.S. Army veteran Brian Mark Lemley Jr., of Elkton, Maryland, and Patrik Mathews, a former Canadian Armed Forces reservist, have pleaded not guilty to charges including transporting a firearm and ammunition with the intent to commit a felony. Bilbrough was 19 and living with his grandmother in Denton, Maryland, at the time of his arrest. He was charged with conspiracy to transport and harbor Mathews, who is accused of illegally entering the U.S. from Canada. Authorities said the three men were members of The Base and that the group's goal was to accelerate the overthrow of the U.S. government and replace it with a white supremacist regime. Authorities in Georgia and Wisconsin arrested four other men linked to The Base early this year. Lemley and Mathews discussed “the planning of violence” at a gun rights rally in Richmond, Virginia, in January, according to prosecutors.\n",

      " THE Utah monolith, which mysteriously appeared and then disappeared, may have been taken to Area 51 for analysis by the US military, according to a bizarre conspiracy theory. Area 51: 'Underground base' spotted on site of range Alien hunters and conspiracy theorists were sent into a frenzy on November 18 when a helicopter flyby from the Utah Department of Public Safety found a huge metal structure in the middle of the Utah desert. The mysterious monolith popped up without reason and warning, leading experts to be baffled over its discovery. However, as mysteriously as it arrived, the monolith vanished over the weekend of November 28. Related articles The strange 12 ft (3.7m) high metal oblong prompted wild speculation across the internet, with theories ranging from an art installation to a film prop - and even aliens. One alien hunter believes there is a chance the structure was taken by the US military, so it could be analysed at the secretive Area 51. Prominent conspiracy theorist Scott C Waring gave his theories on where the monolith vanished to.\n",

      " Mining giant Glencore lays out climate plan as CEO retires BERLIN (AP) — Mining giant Glencore said Friday that it aims to stop adding greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere by 2050. The Anglo-Swiss company, which is one of the world's biggest miners of coal, said it plans to cut emissions from all parts of its business by 40% in the next 15 years compared with 2019 levels, before going to ‘net zero’ by mid-century. The term net zero means Glencore will only emit as much carbon dioxide and other planet-warming gases as can be absorbed again through technological and natural means. Several countries and companies have recently pledged to aim for net zero by 2050 as part of global efforts to curb climate change. Scientists say man-made greenhouse gas emissions need to drop drastically in the coming decades in order to keep global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) as agreed in the 2015 Paris climate accord. Glencore said it aims to shrink its carbon footprint by reducing coal production, expanding its metals portfolio — including those needed for battery production — and boosting low emission technologies. But the company also said it expects fossil fuels to play an important role “for many years to come” and that it won't sell off its coal mines.\n",

      " Norway's deputy central bank chief resigns over China ties COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The deputy governor of Norway’s central bank is stepping down with immediate effect after he was not granted a new security clearance because he has ties to China via his wife. The move comes at at time when several Western governments are tightening security controls against potential influence from China, particularly in technology, finance and other corporate sectors. “The Norwegian Civil Security Clearance Authority informs me that the reason that I will not receive a renewed security clearance is that my wife is a Chinese citizen and resides in China, where I support her financially,” Jon Nicolaisen said in a statement on Friday. It was unclear if Nicolaisen's wife has any ties to the Chinese government or other interests. The Norges Bank governor, Oeystein Olsen, said they had taken note of the decision and that Nicolaisen had ”performed his duties superbly as a close colleague and competent professional.” Nicolaisen was appointed in 2014 and reappointed April 1, 2020, when he was given special responsibility for managing the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, worth $1.2 trillion.\n",

Mike DeWine. Ohio expects close to 100,000 doses by mid-December. The Pfizer doses require two for each person taking the vaccine, meaning the initial distribution will go to around 49,000 Ohioans. The state’s distribution plan is expected to put a priority on first responders such as health care workers, nursing home residents, people considered at high-risk for the coronavirus because of medical problems, teachers and school staff members, and others, according to a draft distribution plan. The 7-day rolling average of daily new cases in Ohio has risen over the past two weeks from 7,451new cases per day on Nov. 19 to 9,158 new cases per day on Dec. 3, according to an Associated Press analysis of data provided by The COVID Tracking Project.

The Vienna-based regional security organization plays an important role in trying to resolve conflicts in Europe and on its periphery, including Ukraine. Its 57 members include Russia and the United States. A career diplomat, the 59-year-old Schmid was the German embassy's spokeswoman in Washington during the early 1990s, before taking senior roles at the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin, and later moved to Brussels. She spent the last four years as the head of the EU's diplomatic service. The post of OSCE secretary general comes with a three-year term that can be renewed once. The secretary general is the administrative head of the OSCE, complementing the presidency which rotates annually among member states. A branch of the organization also conducts election monitoring missions, including during last month's U.S. presidential vote.\n",

      " Young Lions Offensive Lineman Receives Impressive Award Nomination As is common this time of year, the Detroit Lions have seen one of their own get nominated for a very impressive NFL award. Thursday, center Frank Ragnow was named the team’s nominee for the annual Art Rooney Sportsmanship award. The award is given out annually and a player from each team across the league is nominated around this time in early December. The list is then whittled down and a winner is revealed around the Super Bowl as part of the NFL Awards show. Ragnow makes sense as this year’s nominee, as he is just as good off the field as he is on the field and is a true positive example for the Lions at this point in his young career. Ragnow has only been in the league for a few seasons, but it’s nice to see him making an impact on the team and getting recognized for what he’s been able to do on the field so far. Frank Ragnow Lions Career It’s been a great start to Ragnow’s career in Detroit. At first he played guard, but then switched back to his natural college position of center. Ever since that happened, Ragnow has played great and the team’s line has taken on a new look. A first round pick out of Arkansas in 2018, Ragnow has made a big impact for the Lions and looks like one of the team’s true building blocks moving forward. By receiving this honor, that only looks like more of the case. Ragnow looks like he is going to remain a force for the Lions into the future not simply on the field but off. His work in such a short time since joining the team has been impressive, and even if he never takes home this award, it’s great to note that he was a nominee and is someone who is being recognized for his excellence.\n",

The Lakers picked up Montrezl Harrell in free agency and the move probably didn’t sit very well with most of the Clippers’ roster. Marcus Morris was one of the view players they retained in free agency and he sounds like he’s got a massive chip on his shoulder. Morris got to talk about the losses of Harrell and JaMychal Green this offseason and used some strong language to describe what the Clippers plan to do to them. “We’re just gonna have to beat their a** too,” Morris said Thursday, via Farbod Esnaashari of Sports Illustrated. Morris has a strong personality but the Clippers aren’t better than the Lakers so they’re going to have a hard time living up to his claim. Morris Throws Shade at Nuggets Despite the disastrous ending to the Clippers’ season, Morris is still supremely confident. They had one of the worst collapses in recent playoff history against the Denver Nuggets but Morris still decided to take a shot at them. “I think it hurt people being up 3-1,” Morris said. “It’s not about the losing, it’s about how we lost. And I think that’s the biggest motivation for this team, because at the end of the day, that team wasn’t better than us. We all knew that.

      "49ers corner Richard Sherman will be a free agent this offseason. Richard Sherman is set to hit the free-agent market this offseason leaving the San Francisco 49ers with one of several difficult decisions. 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan emphasized that the team would like to have Sherman back despite his recent injury. “I don’t think it ever is as simple as that,” Shanahan explained, via 49ersWebZone.com. “Sherm’s a guy that I know I personally, and I know [general manager] John [Lynch] feels the same, we went on our team at all times. Sherm’s a guy that when he does get older and he does descend, he’s such a good football player, he finds a way. I understand his contract issue this year. I understand there’s a number of guys on our team with that this year, but whoever can help us win football games our guys are trying to figure out how to bring back, especially guys who do it the right way.” Sherman has an $8 million salary this season as part of his three-year, $27.1 million contract, per Spotrac. Aside from this season, Sherman has maintained relatively good health with the 49ers playing in 15 and 14 games respectively the last two seasons. Heading into Week 13, Sherman has only played in two games this season but appears to be recovered from a leg injury that sidelined him for the first half of 2020. Shanahan on Sherman: ‘He’s Been Everything We’ve Hoped and More’ Shanahan was extremely complimentary of Sherman but admitted the team has to work within the salary cap restraints. The 49ers coach noted that Sherman has been “everything we’ve hoped for and more.”\n",

      " Dec 4 (Reuters) - Wall Street’s main indexes were set to open near all-time highs on Friday as worse-than-expected jobs growth in November spurred bets of a new fiscal stimulus package to help lift the economy from its worst downturn in decades. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 245,000 last month after rising by 610,000 in October, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May. “For now, the job market recovery is over until the winter wave of COVID-19 is behind us,” said James McDonald, CEO and chief investment officer of Hercules Investments, based in Los Angeles. “Whether or not we see a double-dip recession in the U.S. depends on the interplay between the severity of the shutdowns and their impact on the economy over the winter and the size of potential stimulus from Congress and the Federal Reserve.” A $908 billion stimulus plan gained momentum in Congress on Thursday after a months-long standoff between Republicans and Democrats over aid for businesses and millions of people affected by virus-led shutdowns.

It said it will create more opportunities for Singaporeans to take on technology and fintech roles, and will equip them with skill sets in cyber and information security, data science and analytics, as well as tech engineering. The roles filled have been in areas such as product, data, cyber security and technology. The new entity will focus on serving consumers and small businesses, starting with young professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs), gig workers with flexible incomes, and micro-SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises). It aims to enable these groups to easily access transparent financial services that are embedded in their everyday activities, although it does not have any concrete plans yet about the services it plans to roll out.

      " Mining giant Glencore lays out climate plan as CEO retires BERLIN -- Mining giant Glencore said Friday that it aims to stop adding greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere by 2050. The Anglo-Swiss company, which is one of the world's biggest miners of coal, said it plans to cut emissions from all parts of its business by 40% in the next 15 years compared with 2019 levels, before going to ‘net zero’ by mid-century. The term net zero means Glencore will only emit as much carbon dioxide and other planet-warming gases as can be absorbed again through technological and natural means. Several countries and companies have recently pledged to aim for net zero by 2050 as part of global efforts to curb climate change. Scientists say man-made greenhouse gas emissions need to drop drastically in the coming decades in order to keep global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) as agreed in the 2015 Paris climate accord. Glencore said it aims to shrink its carbon footprint by reducing coal production, expanding its metals portfolio — including those needed for battery production — and boosting low emission technologies. But the company also said it expects fossil fuels to play an important role “for many years to come” and that it won't sell off its coal mines.\n",

That ruling ordered any cases pending appeal when the court’s opinion was filed, and where the defense attorneys had asked to question jurors, be overturned.

      " WASHINGTON — Joe Biden said Thursday that he will ask Americans to commit to 100 days of wearing masks as one of his first acts as president, stopping just short of the nationwide mandate he's pushed before to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The move marks a notable shift from President Donald Trump, whose own skepticism of mask-wearing has contributed to a politicization of the issue. That's made many people reticent to embrace a practice that public health experts say is one of the easiest ways to manage the pandemic, which has killed more than 275,000 Americans. The president-elect has frequently emphasized mask-wearing as a “patriotic duty\" and during the campaign floated the idea of instituting a nationwide mask mandate, which he later acknowledged would be beyond the ability of the president to enforce. Speaking with CNN's Jake Tapper, Biden said he would make the request of Americans on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20. “On the first day I'm inaugurated, I'm going to ask the public for 100 days to mask. Just 100 days to mask — not forever, just 100 days. And I think we'll see a significant reduction” in the virus, Biden said. The president-elect reiterated his call for lawmakers on Capitol Hill to pass a coronavirus aid bill and expressed support for a $900 billion compromise bill that a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced this week. “That would be a good start. It's not enough,” he said, adding, “I'm going to need to ask for more help.”\n",

The other, a lean, lanky 23-year old, who transformed from injury-plagued enigma into the NBA’s Most Improved Player and All-Star. Together, they share enough talent and upside to realistically constitute a contending core. Even if they come at it from different places.

Now, for the foreseeable future they’ll stand together. “I want to say congrats to Brandon,” Williamson said earlier this week. “Brandon was more than deserving of that max(imum) contract. All that extra work he put in. Always trying to get better and being a great teammate, so I’m glad he’s going to stick around.\n",

This marks the second time Jordan, now in his 10th NFL season, has earned this award. He was also named the NFC Defensive Player of the Month in November 2017. Three of those sacks came two weeks ago against the Atlanta Falcons, when Jordan paced a team effort that dropped Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan eight times. In his last two games against Atlanta, Jordan has seven sacks. Jordan ranks eighth among active NFL players and second in Saints franchise history with 93.5 career sacks.

      " Pfizer's coronavirus jab may not prevent vaccinated people from spreading coronavirus, the firm's chairman admitted this week. 'I think that's something that needs to be examined. We're not certain about that right now,' said Albert Bourla, when asked by Dateline's Lester Holt about whether the shot would prevent transmission during the interview, which aired Thursday night. The interview was recorded shortly before Pfizer confirmed that it will only be able to ship 50 million doses of its vaccine by the end of the year - half as many as the 100 million the pharmaceutical giant had promised - due to supply chain issues. It's the latest in a series of tumultuous developments for the vaccine-maker this week. Its shot became the first approved in the West on Wednesday when it was greenlit in the UK. Clinical trials found the shot to be 95 percent effective at preventing people from developing COVID-19, which could mean stemming the pandemic's deadliness and burden on health care systems worldwide. But Pfizer didn't collect data that would show whether volunteers who got its shot transmitted the virus (nor have other companies offered such data), so it's possible that highly-contagious virus could continue spreading after we have vaccines. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla admitted on Thursday that while the firm's shot blocked 95% of coronavirus infections in trials, he doesn't know if it prevents vaccinated people from spreading the virus. This was not measured in trials\n",

      " US job gains stall in November as Covid-19 cases surge Analysts fear the impact of the next few months as unemployment benefits adn eviction moratoriums expire The US economy showed more signs the recovery is stalling as Covid-19 cases surge and more businesses are forced to close, adding a disappointing 245,000 new jobs in November, the government reported Friday. And while the Labor Department data showed the unemployment rate dipped to 6.7 percent from 6.9 percent, the lowest since the pandemic struck, 10.7 million workers remain unemployed. The ranks of long-term unemployed -- those jobless for 27 weeks or more -- increased by 385,000 to 3.9 million, and more Americans left the workforce entirely, the report said, as the participation rate dipped two-tenths to 61.5 percent. The consensus estimate was for a gain of 650,000 positions last month, but many economists warned the result could come in much lower, given signs hiring had slowed as the coronavirus returned with a vengeance. And economists warn the situation could worsen as Republicans and Democrats remains at odds over a relief package to replace the $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in March. Many of the provisions of that measure have already expired and millions of workers are set to lose unemployment benefits just after Christmas.\n",

But if their aim is to finish the wall snaking through the desert before Joe Biden moves into the White House in January, then it is almost certainly mission impossible. Instead the president-elect looks set to inherit a partially built barrier that stands as a testament to Trump's tough policies towards undocumented migrants he once described as criminals and \"rapists.\" Biden is expected to halt work on a project he has criticized as a waste of $15 billion.

Of these, funding is predictably Hurdle No. 1 for Africa, home to some of the world's poorest countries.

      " The Rolling Stones perform onstage at Madison Square Garden in a scene from 'Gimme Shelter.' Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images Fifty years ago this Sunday, the Rolling Stones released Gimme Shelter, the infamous documentary that started as a look at the final days of the British bad boys’ legendary 1969 tour, leading up to the disastrous free concert at Altamont Speedway. It ended up becoming the ultimate rock & roll horror movie. Directors Albert Mayles, David Mayles and Charlotte Zwerin’s time capsule is always a trip to revisit, but especially now — after nine months without live music, even Altamont looks tantalizing. It’s tough to watch the film in 2020 without musing, “I would totally risk a pool-cue flogging from acid-crazed bikers for a few minutes of the Jefferson Airplane.” Released in December 1970, Gimme Shelter is really two movies in one. The first half is the Stones wrapping up their U.S. tour, from Madison Square Garden to Muscle Shoals. The second half is Altamont. The first half is sex, the second is violence; the first half is a band making history, the second is history striking back at the band. The secind half is the main reason this rockumentary is a classic. But the first half is more fun, and a better movie with far wilder music. In a way, it’s also more shocking — how could any live band hit such heights? The best moment is after the Stones rip up “Honky Tonk Women,” with Mick Jagger prancing in his skintight catsuit and red scarf. “I think I burst a button on me trousers,” he confides to the crowd. “You don’t want my trousers to fall down, now do ya?” Related Related The crowd, it’s safe to say, has no problem at all with the idea of Mick losing his trousers.\n",

      " \"This is a goodbye to the 'Traces' record,\" Steve Perry says of his new companion album. Myriam Santos* Steve Perry believes that any great song should be able to withstand a campfire test. “You take any song and sit near a campfire with an acoustic guitar and sing it, the song should be able to survive,” says the former Journey frontman. “It should work just as a melody with lyrics. If the vocal is strong enough to stand on its own, you’ll know it right away.” About six months ago, Perry began thinking that the songs from his 2018 comeback LP Traces could survive such a test. He loved the arrangements on the finished album, but many of the songs began as simple demos and he wanted fans to hear them in this raw form. “I love rock & roll and I love the production of rock & roll,” he says. “But there’s something to be said for ultimate simplicity.” There are 19 songs on Traces, but Perry wound up focusing on just seven of them for his new album Traces (Alternate Versions and Sketches). (“Most of All” appears in two incarnations.) These new versions of the songs combine elements from the original recordings with new vocal parts and instrumentation that he laid down earlier this year. Related “This is a goodbye to the Traces record,” he says. “That’s because I have so much other material sitting around and new stuff I’ve written. I haven’t put any drums on [the new songs] and I have no idea when they’ll come out. They’re just sketches now in the seed position, just like what you hear on Traces (Alternate Versions and Sketches).“\n",

We’ll be rolling these pieces out throughout December. After two years since his last project, Portland rapper Aminé returned in 2020 with a new album, Limbo, that showed once again why he’s one of the most creative and compelling MCs out there. While the rapper was unable to hit the road in support of the record due to the coronavirus, he says being stuck in lockdown helped him realize how much he took the touring life for granted, even at its most grueling. Or, as he more succinctly described the epiphany: “Sometimes I’d even say that I hated touring. Now I realize I was being a bitch.” Still, there was plenty at home to keep him busy, including an array of TV shows and a newfound love of cooking (he says learning to make the Ethiopian dish Shiro, which his mom often made, was a personal highlight). And as the year comes to an end, Aminé has plenty to celebrate and look forward to in 2021: On Friday, he released a deluxe edition of Limbo with seven new tracks, and just last month notched his first Grammy nomination for Best Dance Recording for “My High” with Disclosure and Slowthai.

Takieddine was once the main accuser in an inquiry into suspected Libyan financing of Sarkozy's 2007 election campaign. The businessman was investigated in late 2016 after he told the press he had delivered millions of euros in cash from Libyan dictator Moamer Kadhafi. Sarkozy caught a break last month when Takieddine suddenly retracted his claim.

According to the White Stripes, “Let’s Shake Hands” is the first song the duo recorded together in their living room; the track was released as a seven-inch single in 1998, prior to the arrival of their self-titled debut LP a year later. Third Man Records, which revealed the Greatest Hits tracklist in a White Stripes-themed crossword puzzle, said of the collection: “In an era of streaming where the idea of a ‘Greatest Hits’ album may seem irrelevant — that an act’s most streamed songs are considered their de facto ‘hits‘ — we wholeheartedly believe that great bands deserve ‘Greatest Hits’ and that a large part of Third Man Records’ and the White Stripes’ successes have been built on zigging when the rest of the music business is zagging. Thus, for a great band with great fans, a greatest hits compilation for the White Stripes is not only appropriate, but absolutely necessary.” The White Stripes also previously announced that various “value items” will be available on a first-come, first-serve basis for those who purchase Greatest Hits at select independent record stores in the U.S. A list of participating record stores is available here.\n",

      " WHO chief warns poor could be 'trampled' in vaccine push World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, seen at an event in October 2020, is warning that the poor could be \"trampled\" as vaccines are rolled out for Covid-19 The head of the World Health Organization warned Friday that the poor risk being \"trampled\" as wealthy nations roll out Covid-19 vaccines, which he said should be a public good. Speaking at a virtual UN summit on the pandemic, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the world was seeing \"light at the end of the tunnel\" in the nearly year-long Covid crisis. \"But let me be clear. We simply cannot accept a world in which the poor and marginalized are trampled by the rich and powerful in the stampede for vaccines,\" Tedros said. \"This is a global crisis and the solutions must be shared equitably as global public goods. Not as private commodities that widen inequalities and become yet another reason some people are left behind,\" he said. He also warned that the world has plenty of other challenges, saying: \"There is no vaccine for poverty, no vaccine for hunger. There is no vaccine for inequality. There is no vaccine for climate change.\"\n",

A run-down housing estate in Wolverhampton is to get 53 new homes as part of the next phase in a major regeneration project costing £120 million. The Heath Town estate - built in the 1960s - consists mainly of high-rise tower blocks, maisonettes and houses. The second part of the area's ongoing transformation will see a mix of one and two-bedroom properties being built on three streets. Work is under way in Chervil Rise, Long Ley and Tremont Street after the city council gave the go-ahead this week.

      " A review of this week’s The Mandalorian, “The Tragedy,” coming up just as soon as we travel with the windows down… There’s a famous line from the end of the classic John Ford film The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, where a newspaper editor responds to hearing the honest account of a Wild West myth by declaring, “When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.” What people really want, he’s arguing, is a good story more than the truth, and he aims to keep giving the people what they want. For more than 40 years, Star Wars and the fandom have been printing the legend when it comes to Boba Fett. Based solely on what he does in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Boba should at best be a minor figure, ranking slightly above Greedo or Lobot in importance, but below Grand Moff Tarkin or Bail Organa. Yes, he tracks Han Solo and friends to Cloud City; but otherwise, he does nothing, and seems to die in humiliating fashion when Han accidentally knocks him into the Sarlacc pit early in Jedi. But his armor looks incredibly cool, and he was introduced under unusual circumstances — first appearing in the one part of the Star Wars Holiday Special that people didn’t hate, then with an action figure fans could only order by mail. So a mystique built up around the guy out of proportion to what he did or said in the movies, to the point where otherwise reasonable people like my Rolling Stone colleagues would do something insane like ranking him third overall on a list of the 50 best Star Wars characters ever. George Lucas seemed to understand that he never really used Boba to his full effect in the original films, which led to the introduction of Temuera Morrison as Boba’s father Jango in the prequels. Related Related Still, when this season’s Mandalorian premiere gave us Timothy Olyphant wearing that classic armor, it was hard not to notice how much more exciting the idea of Boba Fett became. Here he was, played by a charismatic actor who got to talk a lot and kick ass to a degree Boba simply wasn’t allowed to in his earlier appearances. The premiere ended with a glimpse of a bald, robed figure played by Morrison, and while some speculated that this was one of the many Republic troopers cloned from Jango (Captain Rex, perhaps?), the simplest answer was that it was Boba himself, who had survived the Sarlacc just as well as his armor did. “The Tragedy” confirms this, as well as the fact that he was the mysterious figure approaching Fennec Shand’s body at the end of Season One’s “The Gunslinger.” When Mando and Baby Yoda Grogu arrive at the Seeing Stone on the planet of Tython, Mando is startled to see a ship has followed them — a ship with the familiar silhouette of Boba Fett’s Slave I from Empire (a vessel nearly as cool as the armor itself). While the kid is inside an impregnable Force field, Mando goes to confront his pursuers, and discovers that Fennec survived his attack with the help of Boba Fett (and some new mechanical guts). But the swift arrival of Moff Gideon’s troops postpones any further talk, and soon the trio are working together against this much larger force.\n",

      " California fire danger remains high even as winds ease LOS ANGELES (AP) - Fire danger remained high Friday amid unpredictable wind gusts and dry conditions in Southern California, as crews made progress against blazes that burned several homes and injured two firefighters. The region's notorious Santa Ana winds decreased slightly but red flag warnings of extreme wildfire risk were in place into the weekend because of low humidity. After the weather calms in the southern part of the state, winds are expected to increase in Northern California starting Sunday, forecasters said. Firefighters were still busy trying to contain a number of blazes south and east of Los Angeles. The biggest began late Wednesday as a house fire in Orange County´s Silverado Canyon that spread to dry brush by fierce winds. Some 25,000 people were ordered to flee their homes, although some evacuations orders were later lifted. The fire grew to 10 square miles (26 square kilometers) and blanketed a wide area with smoke and ash. It was 10% contained as calmer conditions helped hundreds of firefighters who fought the flames on the ground and by air. Two firefighters were hurt battling the blaze but there was no immediate word on their conditions, fire officials said. Some residents said they didn't receive evacuation alerts because Southern California Edison had shut off power as a precaution before the fire erupted, leaving them without cellphone service.\n",

      " Suga, who took office in mid-September, set climate change as one of his main policy goals along with promoting a digital transformation of Japanese society - issues which were left behind by his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, who resigned because of ill health. \"The fund is to bolster environmental investment as we aim to become a global leader in this area,\" Suga said. He pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 in a policy speech in October, though it will be a major challenge given Japan´s significant reliance on fossil fuel. Suga, in his first full-fledged news conference since taking office, said Friday that his Cabinet plans next week to approve an economic package that will also include 1 trillion yen ($9.5 billion) to promote the country's digital transformation - a weakness that Japan recognized when companies were requested to allow employees to work from home in response to the coronavirus and many were unable to. Although he is known for a pragmatic approach to getting things done, it's unclear whether Suga has the political heft to overcome vested interests in weaning the resource-poor nation from its reliance on imported oil and gas.

One became known as one of Wales' great utility backs of the early post-war era, who held down a dirty, back-breaking job underground at the same time his tactical prowess on the pitch singled him out as being amongst the sport's shining lights. The other, from more than 11,500 miles away, made a name for himself as a similarly hard-as-nails fullback who could notoriously kick goal from the halfway mark in just his bare feet - something that would make even today's toughest players wince. Indeed, Treorchy -born Billy Cleaver, aka Billy the Kick, and Kiwi Robert Scott - otherwise known as Barefoot Bob - were even born in the same year as each other, namely 1921. Both men would also eventually end up facing off against each other under the floodlights in three of the British Lions' test matches against the All Blacks on their tour of New Zealand in 1950. And these once fierce rivals are to face off against each other again as vintage jerseys from each late player's heyday are to go under the hammer this weekend.

The move comes at at time when several Western governments are tightening security controls against potential influence from China, particularly in technology, finance and other corporate sectors. \"The Norwegian Civil Security Clearance Authority informs me that the reason that I will not receive a renewed security clearance is that my wife is a Chinese citizen and resides in China, where I support her financially,\" Jon Nicolaisen said in a statement on Friday. It was unclear if Nicolaisen's wife has any ties to the Chinese government or other interests. The Norges Bank governor, Oeystein Olsen, said they had taken note of the decision and that Nicolaisen had \"performed his duties superbly as a close colleague and competent professional.\" Nicolaisen was appointed in 2014 and reappointed April 1, 2020, when he was given special responsibility for managing the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, worth $1.2 trillion.\n",

      " Greek FM: Turkey's moves to ease tensions 'unconvincing' NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Turkey´s recent moves to de-escalate a clash with Greece and Cyprus over east Mediterranean energy reserves are \"unconvincing\" and European Union leaders need to take action that will prompt Ankara to heed international law, Greece´s foreign minister said on Friday. Nikos Dendias said Turkey opted not to seize an opportunity that European Union leaders offered it in October to ease tensions in the region so that the 27-member bloc could start reshaping its fraught relations with Ankara. Turkey last week ordered the research vessel Oruc Reis back to port after completing what it said was seismic research in east Mediterranean waters. The warship-escorted vessel´s activities in waters where Greece asserts jurisdiction prompted a military build-up between the two neighbors and nominal NATO allies. Greece countered by also sending its warships, and both countries conducted military exercises to assert their claims. NATO stepped in to prevent a potential armed conflict. But Dendias said the ship´s return to port wasn´t enough. \"Turkey´s belated moves in recent days to supposedly de-escalate tensions are not convincing.\" Dendias said after talks with his Cypriot counterpart, Nikos Christodoulides. \"That´s why we have jointly asked all other European Union member states to live up to their responsibilities.\"\n",

      " Ivory Coast ex-president plans to return home from exile ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) - Ivory Coast´s former president Laurent Gbagbo plans to return to his home country after his passport was returned following his acquittal at The Hague last year, his lawyer said Friday. Gbagbo has been unable to return to the West African nation since his January 2019 acquittal under the terms of his release, which had him remain in Belgium after having handed over his passports while awaiting a ruling on an appeal. \"Laurent Gbagbo today received two passports, one ordinary and one diplomatic,\" lawyer Habiba Toure said. \"He welcomes the act just taken by Ivorian authorities which, according to him, goes in the direction of appeasement.\" The diplomatic passport can only be issued with the consent of Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara. Gbagbo plans to return to Ivory Coast this month and has appointed Assoa Adou, secretary general of Gbagbo´s political party, to approach authorities so that he can return in peace and in accordance with his status as former president, Toure said. Gbagbo refused to concede defeat after losing the 2010 election to Ouattara. Both men held inauguration ceremonies and the standoff persisted for months until pro-Ouattara forces captured Gbagbo from his underground bunker. More than 3,000 people died during the 2010-2011 crisis. Gbagbo was brought before the International Criminal Court in 2011 to face charges of crimes against humanity, of which he was acquitted.\n",

(AP) - By late morning on Oct. 28, staff at the University of Vermont Medical Center noticed the hospital´s phone system wasn´t working. Then the internet went down, and the Burlington-based center's technical infrastructure with it. Employees lost access to databases, digital health records, scheduling systems and other online tools they rely on for patient care. In its main laboratory, which runs about 8,000 tests a day, employees printed or hand-wrote results and carried them across facilities to specialists. Outdated, internet-free technologies experienced a revival. \"We went around and got every fax machine that we could,\" said UVM Medical Center Chief Operating Officer Al Gobeille. The Vermont hospital had fallen prey to a cyberattack, becoming one of the most recent and visible examples of a wave of digital assaults taking U.S. health care providers hostage as COVID-19 cases surge nationwide.

The Vienna-based regional security organization plays an important role in trying to resolve conflicts in Europe and on its periphery, including Ukraine. Its 57 members include Russia and the United States. A career diplomat, the 59-year-old Schmid was the German embassy's spokeswoman in Washington during the early 1990s, before taking senior roles at the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin, and later moved to Brussels. She spent the last four years as the head of the EU's diplomatic service. The post of OSCE secretary general comes with a three-year term that can be renewed once. The secretary general is the administrative head of the OSCE, complementing the presidency which rotates annually among member states. A branch of the organization also conducts election monitoring missions, including during last month's U.S. presidential vote.\n",

George Russell, given his chance with Mercedes after Hamilton tested positive for COVID-19, completed a lap of the desert track under floodlights in 54.546 seconds. His time was 0.176 seconds faster than Red Bull driver Max Verstappen and 0.265 ahead of Alexander Albon. Hamilton, who has already clinched the season-long championship, is self-isolating for 10 days and could also miss the year´s final race in Abu Dhabi next weekend. The 22-year-old Russell has bigger feet than Hamilton and had to squeeze into Size 10 racing boots rather than his usual Size 11. Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas, who is fighting to hold off Verstappen for second in the championship, was fourth quickest, 0.322 behind Russell.

Ascension Parish plans to ask voters on April 24 whether to sell off sewer systems File photo -- A common sight in unincorporated Ascension Parish, a white discharge pipe, left, for an individual sewer treatment system empties into a drainage ditch along KC Road north of Gonzales Friday, April 12, 2019. Ascension Parish government plans to ask voters in late April whether the parish should sell off its sewer systems and grant a long-term franchise agreement to a company owned by a Jim Bernhard-led private equity firm, parish officials said. A small group of parish officials and the company, National Water Infrastructure, have been negotiating in private for weeks on a deal that has not been made final or public, but past versions of the proposal have involved steady rate increases for customers of NWI and the underfunded parish system. Any deal would involve roughly 19,000 combined customers of the parish and NWI, the entity that took over from a longtime parish sewer company, Ascension Wastewater Treatment, after Bernhard Capital Partners Management bought the company in April for an undisclosed price. With systems also in East Baton Rouge, Livingston and Iberville parishes, NWI is the largest private sewer company in the state. Bernhard Capital, led by Shaw Group CEO Jim Bernhard, has raised $3 billion and has been looking to invest in utilities as part of its investment strategy.\n",

      " Mining giant Glencore lays out climate plan as CEO retires BERLIN (AP) - Mining giant Glencore said Friday that it aims to stop adding greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere by 2050. The Anglo-Swiss company, which is one of the world's biggest miners of coal, said it plans to cut emissions from all parts of its business by 40% in the next 15 years compared with 2019 levels, before going to `net zero´ by mid-century. The term net zero means Glencore will only emit as much carbon dioxide and other planet-warming gases as can be absorbed again through technological and natural means. Several countries and companies have recently pledged to aim for net zero by 2050 as part of global efforts to curb climate change. Scientists say man-made greenhouse gas emissions need to drop drastically in the coming decades in order to keep global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) as agreed in the 2015 Paris climate accord. Glencore said it aims to shrink its carbon footprint by reducing coal production, expanding its metals portfolio - including those needed for battery production - and boosting low emission technologies. But the company also said it expects fossil fuels to play an important role \"for many years to come\" and that it won't sell off its coal mines.\n",

      " EU extends ban on Pakistan's airline from flying to Europe ISLAMABAD (AP) - The European Union´s aviation safety agency has extended a ban imposed on Pakistan's state-run airline this year barring it from flying to Europe after a plane crash that killed 97 people in the port city of Karachi, a spokesman said Friday. At the time - and while the probe into the May 22 Airbus A320 crash was still underway - authorities acknowledged that nearly a third of Pakistani pilots, 260 out of 860, had cheated on their pilot´s exams. Pakistan International Airlines subsequently grounded 150 of its pilots while a probe by the country´s Civil Aviation Authority into the other pilots is still ongoing. In first imposing the ban, the EU agency said it was \"concerned about the validity of the Pakistani pilot licenses.\" It added that Pakistan was not capable of certifying and overseeing \"its operators and aircraft in accordance with applicable international standards.\" Abdullah Hafeez, a spokesman for Pakistan International Airlines told The Associated Press on Friday that the EU's Aviation Safety Agency informed them about its decision to extend the ban after analyzing a report about additional steps taken by PIA to enhance safety measures. No timeframe was given for the duration of the ban's extension. According to Hafeez, although the agency praised PIA for taking additional safety steps, it opted to have the ban remain in effect until Pakistan resolves an issue related to issuing pilot licenses. He did not elaborate.\n",

      " Smith and CEO Dave Calhoun discussed the challenges facing the 787 program during the company's third quarter earnings call. In the about month since, the conditions they'd described continued, Smith said, prompting them to make a \"modest adjustment to the 787 production rate.\" Over the last year, the production rate for the jet has been steadily reduced multiple times. Even before the pandemic, reductions were announced twice, first from 14 to 12 in October 2019 then to down to 10 in January. Then, citing the financial blow from the COVID-19 pandemic, the target rate was lowered to seven and eventually six per month. Between now and when the company implements the five-per-month rate, the \"effective production rate\" will be below 10, Smith said. The wide-body jet is favored for overseas routes and has therefore been affected by the continued lag in international air travel, which Smith estimated Friday is still down about 90 percent compared to 2019 levels. “While we balance the supply and demand for the near-term impacts and the global pandemic, we do remain confident in the long-term outlook and certainly the health of the 787…The long-term potentials post-pandemic are very robust,\" Smith said. Deliveries of the 787 have been slowed not just by the pandemic but also because of extra inspections being done on completed aircraft to check for several production flaws with the program that were disclosed this year. Those inspections are \"taking longer than previously anticipated,\" Smith said Friday, and there is a \"large number of undelivered 787 aircraft in inventory.\"\n",

      " Man linked to white supremacist group to plead guilty COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) - A Maryland man who is scheduled to plead guilty Tuesday in a case stemming from his alleged membership in a white supremacist group wants a federal judge to immediately sentence him at the hearing, a court filing shows. William Bilbrough IV agreed to a specific term of imprisonment as part of his plea deal, a federal prosecutor said in a court filing Thursday. The filing does not specify a charge to which Bilbrough will plead guilty or the length of the prison term he would serve if U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang accepts the plea agreement's terms. FBI agents arrested Bilbrough and two other men in January as part of a broader investigation of a group called The Base. U.S. Army veteran Brian Mark Lemley Jr., of Elkton, Maryland, and Patrik Mathews, a former Canadian Armed Forces reservist, have pleaded not guilty to charges including transporting a firearm and ammunition with the intent to commit a felony. Bilbrough was 19 and living with his grandmother in Denton, Maryland, at the time of his arrest. He was charged with conspiracy to transport and harbor Mathews, who is accused of illegally entering the U.S. from Canada. Authorities said the three men were members of The Base and that the group's goal was to accelerate the overthrow of the U.S. government and replace it with a white supremacist regime. Authorities in Georgia and Wisconsin arrested four other men linked to The Base early this year. Lemley and Mathews discussed \"the planning of violence\" at a gun rights rally in Richmond, Virginia, in January, according to prosecutors.\n",

      " Next week, Columbians will be able to watch movies in a Main Street cinema for the first time since it closed due to COVID-19 in March. The Nickelodeon Theatre, the city’s lone arthouse theater, will reopen on Dec. 11 to show a diverse slate of holiday-centered movies through the end of the month, screening “Elf,” “Friday After Next,” “A Christmas Story,” “Polar Express” and “Gremlins” during its first weekend back in action. The Nick joins a scant array of movie theater options available at the moment. With Regal Cinemas closed nationwide, Columbia's AMC theaters and the Spotlight Cinemas location on St. Andrews Road remain in operation, reinforced by outdoor options such as screenings at Segra Park. The move, announced via social media on Dec. 3, comes as coronavirus case numbers continue to spike in South Carolina and across the nation, but Anita Floyd, executive director of the Columbia Film Society, which oversees the theater, said her team feels they can keep audiences safe. “We feel like we have a very strong plan,” she posited. “It’s certainly a conservative one.” “We’re voluntarily keeping our capacity to 25 percent,” Floyd elaborated, “so that gives plenty of opportunity for social distancing. We’ve got a careful plan for that. We’ll have people being seated to make sure that that happens. \"And obviously, the most important thing for any of us anywhere is to wear a mask, so that’s what we’ll be asking our patrons to do,\" she added. \"Some of the things that put you at risk are when you’re vocalizing, and obviously we’re a no-talk theater, so these are things that at least we have some advantages compared to folks who are other places.”\n",

The 23-year-old missed the first chunk of the year with a back injury and has impressed with his performances since football resumed amid the coronavirus pandemic. But Rashford is now dealing with a shoulder problem, which saw him pull out of England’s November internationals and come off in the second half of Wednesday’s 3-1 Champions League defeat to Paris St Germain. The United forward is a doubt for the Premier League clash against the Hammers but Solskjaer has not given up on him making the trip to the capital. “Marcus has been training this morning, not fully but he’s joined in with the group,” the United boss said. “Obviously his shoulder stopped him finishing the game, so he’s been getting treatment and hopefully he’ll be part of the squad that travels.\n",

      " WHEN health psychologist Kari Leibowitz moved from the US to the Norwegian town of Tromsø, more than 300 kilometres north of the Arctic circle, her research became personal. Inspired by recent findings on the ways in which people’s attitudes influence their mental and physical health, she wondered whether this might be the secret to coping with the long, dark Nordic winter. Her research revealed that many Norwegians have a winter mindset that allows them to thrive in conditions she was dreading. Now back in the US at Stanford University, Leibowitz believes her findings hold lessons for us all, especially for people living in the northern hemisphere who, as the nights draw in, face the dual challenges of winter and a stressful pandemic. David Robson: What are “mindsets” and why are they so important? Kari Leibowitz: I think of mindsets as a framework that helps us simplify information and make sense of the world. And we’re really just at the beginning of unpacking the ways that they can shape our health and well-being. A lot of my research now is looking at how we can use mindsets in clinical practice. In one of the last studies that I did, we tested the effects of changing people’s mindsets – even without treatment. We brought our participants to the lab and we pricked them with histamine, triggering a minor allergic reaction that looks a bit like a mosquito bite. For some people, a doctor just examined their arm; for the others, the doctor examined their arm and said: “OK, from now on, the itch and irritation will feel better and your …\n",

      " Frank Lampard eager to play down Marcelo Bielsa row on eve of meeting Frank Lampard has moved to put his ‘spygate’ spat with Marcelo Bielsa to bed ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash with Leeds at Stamford Bridge. Lampard and Bielsa will face off for the first time since the 2019 Championship play-offs, when Lampard’s Derby came from behind and beat Leeds 4-3 at the end of a turbulent campaign. Bielsa sent an intern to spy on Lampard’s Derby in training in January 2019, with the Argentinian later paying an EFL fine of £200,000. Lampard insisted he would rather quit than emulate Bielsa’s subterfuge, with the Leeds boss eventually accepting such practices are not acceptable in the English game. Bielsa stirred the pot however by delivering an hour-long PowerPoint presentation press conference, detailing how to analyse opponents in such depth as he had Derby. With no little rancour between the two managers in their Championship exchanges, many had anticipated a frostiness between the pair – but Lampard has joined Bielsa in attempting to dampen down any talk of a lingering feud.\n",

West Brom have suffered a huge blow after learning that left wing-back Conor Townsend has been ruled out for up to six weeks with a knee injury. Townsend has been one of Albion’s best performing players in recent weeks after displacing Kieran Gibbs in the starting line-up and finding his feet in the Premier League, but he hobbled off last Saturday after picking up a problem in the win over Sheffield United. Townsend did initially try and play on, something that boss Slaven Bilic reasoned was typical of the player’s attitude, but he eventually gave into the injury and was replaced by winger Matt Phillips. Make sure you don't miss a thing - click here to sign up to our Albion newsletter With Albion operating in a 3-5-2 system and wing-backs on either side, Townsend has flourished and his input will not be so easily replaced. “I knew straight away.

Klopp has been the most vocal proponent of a return to having the option to make five changes during a match, in line with what happened after lockdown ended last season. However, despite him and a number of other managers supporting the move there was no vote on it at this week’s Premier League meeting. “I’m not surprised. I told you that in the managers’ meeting (in November) if we would have voted that day, which we were not allowed to, it would have been through 100 per cent with 15 or 16 votes,” he said. “That it didn’t happen since then is a sign some shareholders and CEOs and sporting directors see differently from their managers. “That is not a good sign, really, to be honest. These people now really ignore player welfare. “Now pretty much all teams have to play every three days, it will be massive for everybody from now on and every team will feel the difference.\n",

      " Russell could have been excused for showing signs of nerves on his Mercedes debut but the Englishman ended the opening running of the weekend on top. His appearance here is seen as something for an audition for a drive with the sport’s all-conquering team in 2022 and his three-tenth advantage over Bottas in the other Mercedes will have been the start to the weekend Russell would have wanted. George Russell was fastest in first practice in Bahrain (Tolga Bozoglu/AP) The sport is back racing here in Bahrain, just five days after Romain Grosjean’s fireball crash stunned the world. A different track configuration, already scheduled before Grosjean’s accident, is being used, with Russell lapping the 2.17-mile circuit in 54.5 seconds. Verstappen looked as though he will have the pace to challenge Mercedes with his Red Bull team-mate, Alexander Albon, third in the order. Daniil Kvyat finished fifth for AlphaTauri ahead of Pierre Gasly in the other car. British driver Lando Norris was 16th for McLaren, while Brit Jack Aitken, making his debut here, finished last of the 20 runners in Russell’s Williams.\n",

      " England tour of South Africa hanging in balance following shock ODI postponement England’s one-day tour of South Africa hangs in the balance following the postponement of Friday’s series opener in Cape Town, with any further Covid cases in the home camp leading to a potential cancellation. The South African squad received a new positive test on Thursday evening, leading to a series of internal team meetings and hasty discussions between the respective boards, but the match was only officially called off less than an hour before the scheduled start of play at 1pm. By that time England’s pair of team buses were almost at the gates of Newlands, with some individuals thought to be uneasy about the prospect of the fixture going ahead, and the drivers turned back around as news filtered through. The first ODI of our series with South Africa has been postponed until Sunday The entire Proteas party, which also turned up two positives ahead of the Twenty20 series, were set to undergo a fresh round of testing on Friday evening with results due the following mornig. While the England and Wales Cricket Board has not gone on the record about what any additional positives would mean, it appears highly likely that would lead to an early end to the trip. That worst-case scenario would mean England ending an international tour abruptly for the second time in a row, having departed Sri Lanka in March in the early stages of the pandemic.\n",

      " Eddie Jones insists England will not underestimate inexperienced France side England and France will collide in a giant mismatch of experience in Sunday’s Autumn Nations Cup final that even Les Bleus manager Raphael Ibanez accepts can be viewed a “farce”. The 107th meeting between the rivals is the most lopsided Test in history with England fielding their most seasoned line-up of all time containing 813 caps, while France will arrive at Twickenham with a mere 68 caps. The vast disparity in appearances is the result of constraints placed on head coach Fabien Galthie by an agreement between the French Rugby Federation and the Top 14 clubs over availability. Each player can be picked a maximum three times across the autumn’s six Tests and having relied on his front line internationals earlier in the campaign, Galthie is forced to send a shadow team to Twickenham. It has devalued the final to the extent that Ibanez, the former France and Wasps hooker, admits “seen from abroad this final can be regarded as ‘a farce’. We can understand them”. England retain 13 starters from last autumn’s World Cup final in a settled side that shows just one change following last Saturday’s victory over Wales, with Anthony Watson replacing the injured Jonathan Joseph on the right wing.\n",

      " `Scandalous´ first Christmas card up for sale The first commercially printed Christmas card is up for sale, showing a merry Victorian-era scene that scandalised some who denounced it when it first appeared in 1843. The card, being sold online through a consortium run by Marvin Getman, a dealer in rare books and manuscripts based in the US city of Boston, depicts an English family toasting the recipient with glasses of red wine. “A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to You,” it reads. But for teetotallers — and there were plenty of those in the 19th century — the imagery included a bit too much Christmas cheer – in the foreground, a young girl is pictured taking a sip from an adult’s glass. That did not sit well at the time with the puritanical Temperance Society, which kicked up such a fuss it took three years before another Christmas card was produced. “They were quite distressed that in this ‘scandalous’ picture they had children toasting with a glass of wine along with the adults. They had a campaign to censor and suppress it,” said Justin Schiller, founder and president of Battledore, a dealer in antiquarian books who is selling the card.\n",

      " US Air Force to assess what caused B-52 bomber engine to shut down The US Air Force will assess what had caused an engine failure on one of its B-52 bombers which made an emergency landing at RAF Fairford. The aircraft circled around Gloucestershire for around an hour and a half on Thursday to burn off fuel before it landed at the county’s RAF base at around 5.15pm. An RAF spokesman said three B-52 bombers were on a routine sortie from the US across Europe when one aircraft suffered an engine failure. He said the bomber was halfway through the Mediterranean when one of its eight engines shut down, although he added B-52 planes can run on two engines. “They had to make a decision to either continue or divert, if it was a major emergency it would go to the nearest airfield which could’ve been southern Italy or France,” he said. It was flown to RAF Fairford as the airfield accommodates US Air Force personnel and is used to handling B-52 aircraft, he said, but could not confirm where the bomber had flown from or whether it had been carrying weapons.\n",

Grosjean, 34, was back in the Sakhir paddock on Friday, just five days after his terrifying crash at last weekend’s Bahrain Grand Prix. The French driver suffered only minor burns to his hands and was released from the Bahrain Defence Force Hospital on Wednesday. His car penetrated a steel barrier at 137mph, split in two, and burst into flames during the most dramatic accident of recent F1 memory. Recalling the terrifying 28 seconds he fought for his life, Grosjean, with both hands still in bandages, said: “When the car came to a stop, I opened my eyes and I undid my seatbelt straight away.

Biden will outline at his inauguration but that it’s still a good idea to make the defined request. Mr. Biden plans to mandate masks on federal property and interstate transportation and use the bully pulpit to demand face coverings among everyday people across the country. The 100-day period should stretch into the spring, when members of the general public will start to access forthcoming coronavirus vaccines. It’s unclear how smoothly the vaccine process will go, however, or if enough people will roll up their sleeves to bring the virus under control in the first half of the year. “He’s saying hey, ‘Folks, trust me, everybody, for 100 days.’ Now, it might be that after that, that we’re still going to need it. But he just wants everybody for a commitment for 100 days,” Dr. Fauci told NBC’s “Today Show.” “But I discussed that with him, and I told him I thought that was a good idea.”\n",

      " Suga, who took office in mid-September, set climate change as one of his main policy goals along with promoting a digital transformation of Japanese society — issues which were left behind by his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, who resigned because of ill health. “The fund is to bolster environmental investment as we aim to become a global leader in this area,” Suga said. He pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 in a policy speech in October, though it will be a major challenge given Japan’s significant reliance on fossil fuel. Suga, in his first full-fledged news conference since taking office, said Friday that his Cabinet plans next week to approve an economic package that will also include 1 trillion yen ($9.5 billion) to promote the country's digital transformation — a weakness that Japan recognized when companies were requested to allow employees to work from home in response to the coronavirus and many were unable to. Although he is known for a pragmatic approach to getting things done, it's unclear whether Suga has the political heft to overcome vested interests in weaning the resource-poor nation from its reliance on imported oil and gas. He said Japan needs to strive to become a global leader in achieving carbon neutrality, and that investment in the environment is a growth opportunity, not a burden. Suga repeated that he plans to deepen Japan's alliance with the United States and promote a vision of a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” to counter growing Chinese influence in the region.\n",

Solely comprising clubs from Cornwall, the only county currently granted full tier one status, action in the league’s Premier West division might have been expected to resume with some semblance of normality this weekend. Instead, faced with players and fans bussing in from tier two areas, club officials have been spending this week frantically trying to define what constitutes a “substantial meal”, and even struggling with the concept of multi-entry tea huts. St Blazey’s players, who mostly reside in Plymouth despite the club being nestled deep within tier one territory, have taken the unilateral decision not to go into their own clubhouse following their match against Saltash on Saturday.

      "Charles Dharapak / AP / TASS This week’s news that U.S. President-elect Joe Biden had chosen Jennifer Psaki as his administration’s press secretary sparked a flurry of excitement on Russian state media and social media alike. “We are looking forward to Jen's return,” said Vladimir Solovyev, a controversial host on the state-run Rossia 1 broadcaster and one of Russia’s main spin doctors, following the announcement. A little-known official in her home country, Psaki is a celebrity in Russia — even if against her will. Psaki’s rise to Russian stardom stems from her time as State Department spokeswoman from 2013-2015 and as the Obama White House’s communications director from 2015-2017, some of the most contentious years in U.S.-Russia relations. Russian state television pundits and bloggers alike seized on gaffes she made while speaking on Russia-related topics, churning out jokes, satirical memes and videos, and constantly trolling her.\n",

      " Portugal's Madeira tax scheme breached EU state aid rules LISBON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Companies on the island of Madeira have illegally benefitted from tax cuts under Portugal's Madeira Free Trade Zone scheme as they failed to meet the key requirement of contributing to the region's growth, the European Commission said on Friday. Portugal, which first established the regional aid scheme in 1987, will now have to recover aid deemed incompatible with EU state aid rules, plus interest, from companies that failed to meet the conditions, the Commission said in a statement. It gave Portugal eight months to do so. It is not known how many companies could be affected or the total aid amount to be recovered. Critics have long claimed the programme converted Madeira into a tax haven for wealthy individuals and companies that have received billions of euros in tax benefits. The scheme to attract companies by reducing corporate taxes and providing exemptions from other levies was approved by the Commission in 2007 and 2013. But the rules were clear: it could only benefit firms that created jobs in Madeira and applied to activities \"effectively and materially performed\" on the island.\n",

Killian, a mother of two, was reported missing by her family on Thanksgiving night, when she failed to return after going out for cigarettes hours earlier. Her body was discovered under some brush the next day just a block from her St. Peters home. Police said she had been stabbed repeatedly, and a knife was found at the scene. Investigators found text message exchanges with Delgado on Killian’s phone arranging to meet the night she disappeared, police said.

      " NEW YORK, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Growing prospects for a U.S. coronavirus relief package after a grim employment report helped boost demand for riskier assets on Friday, taking the dollar to a new 2-1/2-year low and pushing oil prices to their highest levels since March when widespread lockdowns aimed at curtailing the pandemic took effect. The U.S. economy added the fewest workers in six months in November, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 245,000 jobs last month after rising by 610,000 in October, the Labor Department said on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would increase by 469,000 jobs in November. \"It shows that the economy is still not on firm footing and we need stimulus. The revitalized conversations are important, and this shows that ultimately maybe a bad number will get the politicians to push forward a bit faster,\" said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at State Street Global Markets. A bipartisan, $908 billion coronavirus aid plan gained momentum in the U.S. Congress on Thursday as conservative lawmakers expressed their support. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.30% following mixed trading in Asia and modest gains in Europe. In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 76.68 points, or 0.26%, to 30,046.2, the S&amp;P 500 gained 8.13 points, or 0.22%, to 3,674.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 11.19 points, or 0.09%, to 12,388.38.

The appellate court, in a unanimous judgement by a three-man panel of Justices led by Justice Stephen Adah, said it found no reason to set aside the verdict of a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, which okayed Maryam to die by hanging. It held that the 20 grounds of appeal Maryam filed to challenge her conviction and sentence lacked merit and deserved to be dismissed. Maryam, who was on January 27, found guilty of stabbing her husband, Bilyamin Bello, a real estate developer to death at their Abuja residence in 2017, had in her appeal, maintained that she was denied fair hearing by the trial court.

      " POLL-Brazil central bank to stand pat next week, tighter outlook on the table BUENOS AIRES, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank is likely to leave interest rates unchanged for a third time at its meeting next week, amid growing expectations it will signal the start of a tightening cycle from the second half of 2021, a Reuters poll showed. While recognizing a recent pickup in inflation, officials are set to keep a cautious tone for now, as economic activity is still healing from the coronavirus shock and its human toll in Brazil. All 28 economists in the Nov. 30-Dec. 3 poll expect the bank's rate-setting committee - known as Copom - will maintain the benchmark Selic rate at a record low of 2.0% on Wednesday, ensuring ample liquidity to boost growth. Pushed by rising food costs and a pass-through of this year's currency depreciation, Brazil's annual rate of inflation in mid-November accelerated to 4.2%, above the central bank's year-end target of 4.0%. Central bank president Roberto Campos Neto has stuck to a relaxed view so far as part of his forward guidance for very accommodative monetary conditions, indicating the recent spike in consumer prices was temporary. But economists are increasing forecasts for policy normalization, adding 25 basis points to an expected rate hike in the third quarter of 2021, to 2.50%, and 150 basis points in the first half of 2022 in December's survey, compared with October.\n",

      " Swiss step up corona measures but keep ski resorts open ZURICH, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Switzerland allowed ski resorts to stay open for domestic tourism as the government on Friday announced some stricter measures to control the spread of the novel coronavirus. Ski areas will need local authority approval to operate after Dec. 22, while enclosed transport including ski lifts, trains and gondolas will be limited to two-thirds capacity from Dec. 9, it said. \"Ski resorts should be able to remain open for domestic tourism,\" the government said in a statement, while stressing permits could be revoked if resorts do not adhere to strict safety measures. The Swiss approach contrasts with neighbors France, Italy and Germany which are keeping winter sports under wraps over the holidays. Austria will let resorts reopen for Christmas while making ski holidays nearly impossible. Switzerland, which is battling persistently high number of coronavirus cases, announced a raft of other measures, including a ban on singing outside of family circles and in schools. It recommended gatherings in private and at restaurants be restricted to two households, while it also reduced capacity limits on the number of shoppers allowed into stores at one time and urged employers to let staff work from home.

Biobarakuma Wangagha Degi Eremieyo representing Bayelsa East, to the effect that the latter forged his academic qualifications and documents. In the suit which had the Inspector General of Police IGP, Mohammed Adamu as second defendant, the claimant had sought a declaration “that the First School Leaving Certificate from Ministry of Education of Government of Rivers State of Nigeria with number RS/EV1/76/013360 from State School Bassambiri bearing the name Degi Biobaragha which the 1st defendant claims, and has presented before various authorities as belonging to him and has obtained various benefits on account of same including, in particular, his current membership of the Senate of the National Assembly of Nigeria, was not duly issued to and does not belong to the defendant, but to another person by the stated name, and the use of same by the defendant is unlawful and constitutes a forgery and falsification of same”. He had consequently asked the court to mandate the Inspector General of Police IGP to immediately commence criminal prosecution of Sen. Degi. The Supreme Court had on 13th of February 2020, in its judgement in a pre-election matter in respect of the Bayelsa State Governorship Election, affirmed a Federal High Court Judgement which decided inter alia, that Senator Biobarakuma Wangagha Degi Eremieyo, is disqualified from participating in the election on grounds that he submitted forged and falsified documents and also made false declaration to the Independent National Electoral Commission in aid of his qualification for the election. The judgement led to the invalidation of the election of Chief David Lyon as Governor-elect for Bayelsa State and Sen. Degi as Deputy Governor-elect. However, the FCT High Court presided over by Justice A.O Musa in its judgement dated November 13, 2020 whose certified true copy was made public on Friday, held that “the name Degi Biobaragha on the first school leaving certificate from Ministry of Education of Rivers State of Nigeria with number RS/EV1/76/013360 from State School Bassambiri (now State School 1 Nembe) is an error and misspelling of the 1st defendant’s name, Biobarakuma Degi”.\n",

Giroud, 34, has yet to start a Premier League game this season with Timo Werner and Tammy Abraham preferred over him, and France coach Didier Deschamps urged the striker to sort out his playing time ahead of the European Championship next year. However, Giroud underlined his importance in the Champions League on Wednesday when he scored all Chelsea's goals in a 4-0 demolition of Sevilla to give Lampard a selection headache. \"It's not a case of giving players reassurances over game time, it's difficult to do. You want players out of the team to train well and perform,\" Lampard told reporters ahead of Saturday's home game against Leeds United. \"It gives me nice problems. Oli has always done that, particularly after the restart (last season) when he was fundamental to us getting into the Champions League spots. \"From my point of view I have competition for places.

      " So will Roku customers get “Wonder Woman 1984” by Christmas Day — and does the coming pipeline of WB movies like “Matrix 4” and “Dune” add new pressure for the streaming platform to clinch a deal? It’s unclear. The studio’s surprise windowing move is designed to ratchet up the allure of HBO Max and help WarnerMedia monetize its blockbuster titles through streaming, given the uncertainty that remains about how soon U.S. theaters might return to pre-COVID audience levels. But specifically, it’s a big card up WarnerMedia’s sleeve in the poker match with Roku to try to win a deal. Roku has 46 million users — a sizable black hole in HBO Max’s distribution matrix. Sources confirm to Variety that WarnerMedia and Roku are in active talks. But both sides have signaled that they are unwilling to budge on their positions: Roku wants to keep HBO/HBO Max as a channel it can sell directly to its own customers, while WarnerMedia is insisting that HBO Max be available as a standalone app. The companies are also hashing out the terms for how they will divvy up ad inventory for the ad-subsidized version of HBO Max, which WarnerMedia plans to launch for a reduced price later in 2021. Each company is playing a long game, but both have a lot to lose by not settling their differences as soon as possible. For Roku, the 2020 holiday-shopping season is already in full swing, and consumers are making buying decisions about connected-TV devices now — and the absence of HBO Max will hurt. WarnerMedia, meanwhile, needs to gain more new HBO Max customers to make the economics of its model work. Now WarnerMedia is making HBO Max much more of a must-have service by shattering theatrical windows for Warner Bros. movies. That may have been the deciding factor for Amazon to agree to an HBO Max deal last month for Fire TV, with the tradeoff being that Amazon will no longer have the right to sell HBO through the Prime Video Channels. But the question in the WarnerMedia-Roku situation still remains: Which side needs the other more? As for why Roku wants to retain the ability to sell HBO through the Roku Channel, Wood claimed the model results in higher content viewing among Roku customers than via separate apps, “which benefits us and our content partners economically.” Needless to say, WarnerMedia hasn’t found that a persuasive argument at this point.\n",

      " Jihadists kill 25 soldiers in Mozambique’s restive north Islamist militants in Mozambique killed two dozen soldiers in an ambush attack, military sources told AFP, a significant show of force against the military’s struggle to quell an insurgency in the north. A shadowy jihadist group has wreaked havoc in the northern Cabo Delgado region since 2017, targeting villages and towns in a bid to establish an Islamist caliphate. The insurgents grew bolder this year and took control of large swathes of territory which the army has so far failed to regain. Militants ambushed a group of soldiers driving through the district of Muidumbe on Sunday and opened fire on the group, killing at least 25. Two military sources only confirmed the attack in recent days on condition of anonymity. “The terrorists let the military cars into an area of dense forest and then opened fire with heavy weapons… causing huge casualties in our forces,” a senior military official told AFP on Thursday in the capital Maputo.\n",

With her witty one-liners, she instantly catapulted into global fame. Shuri’s snark brought a sense of unmatched joy audiences will always cherish. Advertisement It’s joy we certainly still need two years later—in 2020. Yet, 2020 is gon’...2020. On Thursday night, Wright shared a YouTube video from a channel named “On The Table.” In a now-deleted tweet, the Mangrove actress simply accompanied the link with a prayer-hand emoji, clearly indicating support of the content. The Black Panther star tweeted a video from “On The Table,” a YouTube discussion channel, where the presenter opined at length about the efficacy of vaccines, the dangers of taking them and the supposed origins of the ingredients of a COVID-19 vaccine. “I don’t understand vaccines medically, but I’ve always been a little bit of a skeptic of them,” the presenter Tomi Arayomi says towards the beginning of his fact-free monologue which was full of personal anecdotes and his own feelings on vaccines generally. After Wright had posted the video to Twitter with the prayer hands emoji, she quickly became embroiled in arguments with users taking her to task for using her platform to spread misinformation on vaccines. The British actress, who is currently starring in Steve McQueen’s acclaimed Small Axe anthology series, countered that she wasn’t against vaccines but thought it was important to “ask questions.” “I think it’s valid and fair to simply ask what’s in it,” she replied to one user.\n",

      " India considers changing new farm laws after mass protests NEW DELHI, Dec 4 (Reuters) - India's government is considering rolling back some parts of its agricultural reforms after they triggered the biggest protests by farmers in years, officials said on Friday. Tens of thousands of farmers were out on the streets around Delhi again on Friday, rallying against three laws that the government says are meant to overhaul antiquated procurement procedures and give growers more options to sell their produce. Farmers fear the legislation, passed in September, will eventually dismantle India's regulated markets and stop the government from buying wheat and rice at guaranteed prices, leaving them at the mercy of private buyers. \"The government is open to look into various amendments,\" a government official told Reuters, declining to be named ahead of a meeting between farmers and ministers scheduled for Saturday. \"The government is open to the idea of imposing taxes on the new wholesale markets to keep a level playing field,\" he said. In case of a dispute between sellers and buyers, the government could also let farmers appeal to a higher court than is currently allowed under the new legislation, he added.\n",

Ozobu, who stated this in an interview with Saturday Vanguard, explained that the South-East zone has benefitted nothing from the PDP despite sustaining the party in power for 16 years. He added that the South-East had gained from the 5 years of the APC through improved infrastructure and need to rejoin the party at the centre to attract more development to the area. According to him, Governor Mala Buni must be saluted for his foresight. He said Governor Dave Umahi has abandoned PDP, and many other leaders are also on their way to the APC. “The South East zone should collapse all party structures in the zone and join the APC en masse.

      " Alibaba Pictures to Focus on Original Content Production, Unveils Surprise Works Unit Courtesy of Alibaba Pictures Group Alibaba Pictures has launched a new in-house film studio modeled on A24 and called “Surprise Works.” The company announced a large line-up of upcoming local projects, which it says herald a strategic shift more firmly towards original content production. In the past, Alibaba Pictures cast itself in more of a complementary than primary role in local production, acting frequently as a joint financier and distributor. It is now seeking to focus more squarely on becoming a strong, standalone player in the original content space, creating works that it can then connect to the larger Alibaba group’s vast e-commerce ecosystem. “In the future, we will strive to achieve diversified content… and create more high-quality works closely related to ‘me’ [the individual] and ‘now,’” said Li Jie, executive director of Alibaba Pictures Group, at a public presentation in Xiamen last week. He cited Disney’s performance this year as an inspiration for the shift, saying that the rapid growth of paid subscribers to the Disney Plus streaming service in the platform’s first year “gives hope to the market.” Such growth was only possible because of the U.S. firm’s continued investment in content, on which it shelled out $1 billion just this year, he assessed. While there has historically been a sharp divide in the Chinese film industry between theatrical and straight-to-streaming movies, it is rapidly melting away as the quality and profitability of ‘internet movies’ improve — a process catalyzed by the pandemic.\n",

      " U.S. factory orders increase more than expected in October WASHINGTON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods increased more than expected in October and business investment on capital was a bit stronger than initially thought as the manufacturing sector continues its steady recovery from the pandemic. The Commerce Department said on Friday that factory orders rose 1.0% after increasing 1.3% in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders increasing 0.8% in October. Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.3% of the U.S. economy, is being supported by a shift in demand towards goods from services because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But there are clouds gathering for the sector. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported this week that its index of national factory activity dropped in November because of the coronavirus. The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, increased 0.8% in October instead of 0.7% as reported last month. Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, accelerated 2.4%. They were previously reported to have jumped 2.3%. Business spending on equipment rebounded in the third quarter, ending five straight quarters of decline. The economy grew at a 33.1% rate in the July-September quarter after contracting at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.

      " The landmark agreement, besides distribution, entails a collaboration to restore and preserve the Titanus library, which is a treasure trove comprising early works by Italo masters such as Federico Fellini and Francesco Rosi, and Luchino Visconti classics, alongside plenty of genre fare including cult horror helmers Dario Argento and Mario Bava. It’s a mix of classics and more rarely seen pics featuring a wide array of late and living Italo stars, comprising Alberto Sordi, Marcello Mastroianni, Sophia Loren, Gina Lollobrigida and Claudia Cardinale (pictured). Established in 1904 by Gustavo Lombardo, Titanus was a true Italian major, which during the 1960s forged a partnership with MGM. They slowed down considerably from the mid-1960s onwards after Luchino Visconti’s lavish Sicily-set costumer “The Leopard” (1963) starring Cardinale and Alain Delon went way over budget. Since the mid-1980s the studio’s output has been on a much smaller scale, and primarily for TV. Besides “The Leopard,” the Titanus archives include several other Italian cinema classics, such as Vittorio De Sica’s 1953 romantic comedy “Bread, Love and Dreams,” and Visconti’s neo-realist “Rocco and his Brothers” (1960), as well as Fellini’s early feature “Il Bidone” (1955) and Ermanno Olmi’s debut “Il Posto” (1961), to name a few. Dario Argento’s “Phenomena,” “The Cat with Nine Tails” and “The Bird with the Crystal Feathers” are among its genre gems. “The agreement with RAI Com allows us to preserve and modernize a cultural patrimony of which we have been jealous custodians over the years,” Titanus president Guido Lombardo said in a statement. “We are entrusting it to a capable partner who will be able to further enhance its value and global reach,” he added. In an interview with Variety, RAI Com managing director Angelo Teodoli said Titanus will handle restoration of its films on RAI Com’s behalf, using top notch specialized laboratories, including Italy’s Cineteca di Bologna and others.\n",

      " ’76 Days’ Review: A Strong, Heart-Pounding Doc From the Medical Frontline of the Pandemic in Wuhan Monitoring hospital activity throughout the city's period of lockdown earlier this year, this unsentimental but fully felt film may be the first essential COVID-19 doc. Courtesy of MTV Documentary Films If the arrival of vaccines offers some hope of the year-consuming COVID-19 pandemic eventually cooling off, the attendant mini-genre of the coronavirus documentary is only getting warmed up. For years to come, we can doubtless anticipate dozen upon dozen of films probing all angles of what happened and how, what went wrong and how much. Some are sure to be hasty and opportunistic, others hopefully more penetrating in their application of hindsight. A documentary like “76 Days,” however, can’t be made too soon: It is, by necessity, an entirely in-the-moment affair, seizing its single chance to chronicle the first wave of medical crisis management in the Chinese city of Wuhan, weeks before the world followed it into a state of lockdown. As an artefact alone, the result is remarkable, capturing all the panic and pragmatism greeting a disaster before its entire global impact had been gauged, while strategies and protocols are adjusted on the hoof. As a film, then, “76 Days” didn’t even need to be as good as it is: That it’s so artfully and elegantly observed, and packs such a candid wallop of feeling, atop its frontline urgency is testament to the grace and sensitivity of its directorial team, not just their timely savvy. Chinese-American docmaker Hao Wu steered and edited the project remotely, never meeting his two China-based co-directors — Weixi Chen and one who has elected to remain anonymous — in person, as they shot and gathered observational footage from four different Wuhan hospitals between January and April of this year. (The title refers to the city’s period of lockdown in that time.) Yet the finished film feels entirely fluent and focused, bearing little trace of its creators’ separation, and maintaining a consistent but unobtrusive point of view. Wu opens proceedings on a direct punch to the gut, as a nurse, clad in a hazmat suit, races down a hospital corridor to say goodbye to her own father, who has been admitted while dying of the virus. She’s too late; the composure expected of her profession deserts her as she breaks down outside the ward, wailing with grief while her colleagues try and fail to calm her. “You must control yourself,” one says: It may sound callous, but if medical workers can’t suppress their terror and despair at the chaos around them, what hope is there for their overwhelming surge of patients? Free of external commentary or context, it’s a devastating vignette that clues us into the film’s blunt, unsentimental human-interest approach: There are other films to be made about the politics of the pandemic, but this is not one.\n",

Glasenberg's departure next year will mark a shift to a new, younger leadership for the business. Glasenberg, 63, has been chief executive since 2002 and investors have been expecting a succession plan after several senior members of management retired in the last few years. \"The board has worked with Ivan over the past two years to oversee a seamless transition to the next generation of leadership across Glencore's business,\" chairman Tony Hayward said. Nagle, a 45-year old South African, takes over a company facing pressure from investors to cut carbon emissions. He has held senior roles in coal and ferroalloys in Colombia, South Africa and Australia. \"We have decided that over the next six months I will be working closely with Gary Nagle who will be taking over from me,\" Glasenberg said on a call. \"Gary started with me in the coal division 21 years ago.\" Also on Friday, Glencore announced plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 by reducing its direct and indirect carbon footprint by 40% by 2035 compared with last year's levels.\n",

      " ‘The Mandalorian’: Has Boba Fett Got His Mojo Back? And More Burning Questions From ‘The Tragedy’ After a wildly exciting episode which gave us the ass-kicking first live-action appearance of Ashoka Tano, this week’s edition of “The Mandalorian” was lighter on big reveals, but heavier on Mando’s parental stress levels. “The Tragedy,” as it’s ominously called, cuts right to the chase with Mando and Grogu (formerly, or not so formerly, known as Baby Yoda) arriving on the planet Tython. Ahsoka told Mando to place Grogu on the seeing stone in the ruins of an old Jedi Temple there, and Mando does just that. After a little while, Grogu begins using the stone to project a massive force field, which Mando cannot penetrate, directly into the air. However, before they can finish their Jedi business, first Boba Fett (Temuera Morrison) arrives with an old friend to take back his armor, then Moff Gideon’s (Giancarlo Esposito) troops crash the party. But no more forcing around, here are some burning questions from “The Tragedy”: How is Fennec Shand still alive? The friend that Boba brings along is the bounty hunter Fennec Shand (played by Ming-Na Wen), whom Mando left for dead on Tatooine in a Season 1 episode. However, as Boba is quick to point out, he too was once thought to have perished on the sand planet, and look what a miraculous Sarlacc pit recovery he made! Shand shows Mando that Boba revived her by inserting robotic parts into her stomach, à la Luke Skywalker’s arm. But that’s not the only trick Boba has up his sleeve…\n",

Local gold futures were at 49,400 rupees per 10 grams on Friday, up from 47,550 rupees earlier in the week which was the lowest level since June 19. Jewellers made substantial purchases last month to replenish inventory, said a Kolkata-based bullion dealer, adding \"a sudden price rise has been confusing jewellers. They are waiting for a clear direction.\" Indian dealers were charging a premium of $3.5 an ounce over official domestic prices this week, inclusive of 12.5% import and 3% sales levies, down from last week's premium of $5.

      " Paul Krugman column: Learn to stop worrying and love government debt Amid all the wild swings in U.S. politics over the past decade, one thing has remained constant: the GOP position on government debt. The party considers high levels of debt an existential threat — if a Democrat is sitting in the White House. If a Republican president presides over big deficits, well, as Donald Trump’s budget director reportedly told supporters last year, “nobody cares.” So it’s a completely safe prediction that once Joe Biden is sworn in, we will once again hear lots of righteous Republican ranting about the evils of borrowing. What’s less clear is whether we’ll see a repeat of what happened during the Obama years, when many centrists — and much of the news media — both took obvious fiscal phonies seriously and joined in the chorus of fearmongering. Advertisement Let’s hope not. For the fact is that we’ve learned a lot about the economics of government debt over the past few years — enough so that Olivier Blanchard, the eminent former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is talking about a “shift in fiscal paradigm.” And the new paradigm suggests both that public debt isn’t a major problem and that government borrowing for the right purposes is actually the responsible thing to do. Why are economists thinking differently about debt? Part of the answer is that we’ve discovered some things about how the world works; the rest of the answer is that the world has changed.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had sparked controversy with an earlier interview in which he said U.K. regulators hadn’t acted “as carefully” as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Dendias and Christodoulides were meeting ... more > NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Turkey’s recent moves to de-escalate a clash with Greece and Cyprus over east Mediterranean energy reserves are “unconvincing” and European Union leaders need to take action that will prompt Ankara to heed international law, Greece’s foreign minister said on Friday. Nikos Dendias said Turkey opted not to seize an opportunity that European Union leaders offered it in October to ease tensions in the region so that the 27-member bloc could start reshaping its fraught relations with Ankara. Turkey last week ordered the research vessel Oruc Reis back to port after completing what it said was seismic research in east Mediterranean waters. The warship-escorted vessel’s activities in waters where Greece asserts jurisdiction prompted a military build-up between the two neighbors and nominal NATO allies.\n",

      " A conservative Christian is baffled by Trump’s behavior | Letters Trump’s behavior baffling I’m a conservative Christian. It’s just the way I believe, I can’t help myself. And I just don’t get the behavior of our current president. History has recorded many individuals who have held a cultlike grip on their followers. The leader is never wrong and verifiable truth is irrelevant. Followers may be willing to resort to violence to further their leader’s goals. Cult leaders have absolutely no patience for those who either disobey or disagree with them, and those who do face retribution. Having a penchant for repeating again and again what only he perceives as truth is another technique in the cult leader’s playbook. Any of this sound familiar? Advertisement Despite our president’s accomplishments while in office (and there are many), his seeming unwillingness to assertively denounce those who threaten violence in his name is morally reprehensible. Doesn’t anyone find it terrifying that such an obvious course of action doesn’t seem to have even occurred to him? During the last four years the media has found our President’s antics addictive. He plays them like fish on a hook. They can’t keep from obsessively reporting on his self-delusional fabrications. It’s become the new normal. Amazingly, they’ve given him the power to delegitimize our next president’s four years in office in the minds of millions of his followers, despite Attorney General William Barr’s statement that he’s seen no evidence of fraud found in the election process.\n",

      " Terrie Rizzo won’t seek another term as chairwoman of the Florida Democratic Party, she announced Thursday in a letter sent to party leaders. Her decision not to run for another term effectively ends her three-year tenure, during which the party gave up a U.S. Senate seat, failed to win the governorship and most recently lost the battle for the state’s rich trove of 29 Electoral College votes in the presidential election. By stepping down, Rizzo avoided mounting scrutiny over the losses. Advertisement Critics blistered the party for failing to offset a finely tuned campaign for President Donald Trump. They said the Democrats failed to keep in touch with important constituent groups such as Hispanics, African-Americans and thousands of wage earners who are struggling to make ends meet during the COVID-19 pandemic. Beyond the Trump win, Democrats lost seats in the U.S. and state houses and two promising state Senate races in Seminole and Miami-Dade counties. And how it happened has a familiar ring. The party infrastructure either isn’t there or is pieced together at the last moment. Outreach to key constituencies, such as African-Americans and Hispanics, comes too late in the election. Candidates don’t aggressively use the tools they do have to target voters and get out the base. “We have to get back to the party of engaging voters year-round,” said state Sen. Shevrin Jones, D-West Park, who won his race in South Florida on Nov. 3. “You can’t continue to come to the Black community in the late hours asking for them to take them to our churches ... and then you drop them like a bad habit after the election.”\n",

      " Paul Krugman column: Learn to stop worrying and love government debt Amid all the wild swings in U.S. politics over the past decade, one thing has remained constant: the GOP position on government debt. The party considers high levels of debt an existential threat — if a Democrat is sitting in the White House. If a Republican president presides over big deficits, well, as Donald Trump’s budget director reportedly told supporters last year, “nobody cares.” So it’s a completely safe prediction that once Joe Biden is sworn in, we will once again hear lots of righteous Republican ranting about the evils of borrowing. What’s less clear is whether we’ll see a repeat of what happened during the Obama years, when many centrists — and much of the news media — both took obvious fiscal phonies seriously and joined in the chorus of fearmongering. Advertisement Let’s hope not. For the fact is that we’ve learned a lot about the economics of government debt over the past few years — enough so that Olivier Blanchard, the eminent former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is talking about a “shift in fiscal paradigm.” And the new paradigm suggests both that public debt isn’t a major problem and that government borrowing for the right purposes is actually the responsible thing to do. Why are economists thinking differently about debt? Part of the answer is that we’ve discovered some things about how the world works; the rest of the answer is that the world has changed.

      " WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden said Thursday that he will ask Americans to commit to 100 days of wearing masks as one of his first acts as president, stopping just short of the nationwide mandate he's pushed before to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The move marks a notable shift from President Donald Trump, whose own skepticism of mask-wearing has contributed to a politicization of the issue. That's made many people reticent to embrace a practice that public health experts say is one of the easiest ways to manage the pandemic, which has killed more than 275,000 Americans. The president-elect has frequently emphasized mask-wearing as a “patriotic duty\" and during the campaign floated the idea of instituting a nationwide mask mandate, which he later acknowledged would be beyond the ability of the president to enforce. Speaking with CNN's Jake Tapper, Biden said he would make the request of Americans on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20. “On the first day I'm inaugurated, I'm going to ask the public for 100 days to mask. Just 100 days to mask — not forever, just 100 days. And I think we'll see a significant reduction” in the virus, Biden said. The president-elect reiterated his call for lawmakers on Capitol Hill to pass a coronavirus aid bill and expressed support for a $900 billion compromise bill that a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced this week. “That would be a good start. It's not enough,” he said, adding, “I'm going to need to ask for more help.”\n",

Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said China was growing its power by stealing US secrets and then replacing US firms in the market. The Trump administration has taken a hard line on China, imposing tariffs on Chinese goods and accusing Beijing of intellectual property theft. \"The intelligence is clear: Beijing intends to dominate the U.S. and the rest of the planet economically, militarily and technologically. Many of China's major public initiatives and prominent companies offer only a layer of camouflage to the activities of the Chinese Communist Party,\" according to Ratcliffe. The Trump administration's most senior intelligence official's stark warning was just the latest from senior administration officials about China's intentions, with some warning of possible military action in Asia and others pointing to unprecedented efforts to influence the incoming Biden administration. The op-ed comes as the Trump administration has recently taken several punitive measures against Beijing, sharply limiting visas for members of the ruling Communist Party of China and unveiling new sanctions on Chinese companies.
