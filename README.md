A dashboard for analysing entities (people and organisations) in the content of recent news articles + media coverage by user sentiment.

It uses the [LatestNews](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/specrom/LatestNewsAPI) API for getting news content. You can find the deployed website [here!](https://newsentity.herokuapp.com/) 

---

## Features:

- Named entities (person or organisation) can be filtered by number to obtain graphs and wordclouds.
- Selecting a particular entity finds other trending topics in the news related to it + groups the various news sources covering the topic to find the intensity of their sentiments using the Afinn Lexicon.
- The `sentiment.py` file creates the dashboard by loading the relevant files. It uses NLTK'S Parts of Speech tagger to chunk the tokens based on their POS tags to find named entities.
- The `ner.ipynb` file contains previous attempts to solve the problem by using scikit-learn's CountVectorizer.
- The dashboard currently only works on a small subset of data for the purpose of this experiment. Expanding it to cover news articles daily remains in the future scope.
