       "' Perth mother Clare* has found herself mostly confined to a small Sydney city apartment with her two young daughters as the northern beaches outbreak takes its toll. Clare flew with Cora, 6, and Georgia, 2, to Sydney on December 11 so they could reunite as a family over Christmas with husband Charles, who has been working remotely for the past year. Perth mother Clare and daughter Cora are in Sydney during the Christmas hard border closure. “It’s pretty tough because we’re in a really small apartment which is not set up for small kids,” Clare said. “We worked on the theory that it’d be fine because we’d be out and about during the day doing tourist things in Sydney. But obviously we’ve tried to stay home as much as we can, apart from a grocery shop.” Advertisement It’s also been raining “a lot”, which has put a damper on escaping to the big parks near their suburb of Haymarket that sits adjacent to tourism hotspot Darling Harbour.'"
